<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was a dull November day, and the flickering light
from the log fire lighted up one side of John
Gaunt’s face—a strong face, with great possibilities
in it for good or evil. The eyes were keen and steady;
the nose commanding, while the lips were rather full, and
would have denoted a nature that might run riot had it
not been for the firmly moulded chin.</p>

<p>His wealth had been gathered by the use of his brains,
and in that fact he took an intense pride. But one thing
had been missing from his life—a friend. Acquaintances
his check-book had brought, and he possessed the
usual parasites that crowd the path of the millionaire.
Life had been too strenuous to allow him to realize that
he was losing a good deal of its sweetness, but latterly he
had been conscious of a fierce longing to find some one
who might become a second self—some one in whom he
could confide, and whom he could trust with his inmost
thoughts. And he imagined that he had found such a
one in Lady Mildred Blythe.</p>

<p>A footman entered and approached with that deprecating
air of the well-trained servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Braithwaite would like to see you, sir.”</p>

<p>Gaunt hesitated, but soon a grim look came to his
face.</p>

<p>“I will see him.”</p>

<p>A few moments later a gentleman, who was evidently
ill at ease, came in and approached Gaunt with a deprecating
air.</p>

<p>“They told me in the City that I should find you
here,” he remarked apologetically.</p>

<p>“Then they failed in their duty. What do you want?”
Gaunt asked curtly.</p>

<p>“You’ve been a good friend to me, and I’m afraid that
I’ve worried you; but it is not my fault, old chap. I’m
desperately hard up—and——”</p>

<p>“Cut it short. I suppose that you want to borrow
again?”</p>

<p>“I thought that you would——”</p>

<p>“In this instance you thought correctly. I owe you
a debt, for you did me a service many years ago. On
several occasions since I have endeavored to repay it.
Now, I will give you a check for a hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>Braithwaite began effusively to express his thanks but
was cut short abruptly.</p>

<p>“This is the last time—and I am a man of my word.
It seems to me that you must be a shiftless kind of person
not to get on, with all the chances you have had.
But I won’t preach. I want you to understand that I
won’t give you another penny piece—not if you are
starving,” Gaunt said with quiet emphasis.</p>

<p>Braithwaite watched his every movement, and when the
check had been signed, almost clutched at the slip of
paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“I am very grateful—and——”</p>

<p>“That’s sufficient. Now you can go,” Gaunt intervened,
and gave him a curt nod of dismissal.</p>

<p>Braithwaite slouched away, and there was a little
more color in his pale cheeks, perhaps brought there
by shame; perhaps by that feeling of exultation
which the sudden acquirement of money gives to the
needy.</p>

<p>Gaunt fell into a reverie, and his thoughts were with
the past. It was a great thing to have succeeded as he
had done, when little more than thirty years of age.
Everything he touched turned to gold, and now he possessed
more than two million pounds; but there was
nothing of the miser in his disposition, for it was not the
gold that he loved, but the power that it represented,
and it was ambition that directed his every step—save
one. It was true that marriage with the woman he had
chosen, Lady Mildred Blythe, would increase his social
prestige, but it was not for that reason that he was
about to offer her his hand and a share of his wealth.
During his early years—that grim time spent on the
Congo—he had not spoken to a white woman, the
amassing of wealth had kept him too busy to think of
love.</p>

<p>A month ago he would have laughed to scorn the idea
of such a marriage and now he knew that everything
else counted as naught, when weighed with his love for
Lady Mildred. Even now he could picture her unerringly,
with her beauty that moved him so strangely.
And yet he realized that if she but knew what an inferno
of passion she had aroused, her answer would be the refusal
of his suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>But there was no nervousness on his face when he was
shown into the room where she awaited him. Lady
Mildred did not rise from the chair, but gave him her
hand and looked at him frankly.</p>

<p>“What news, Mr. Gaunt? How is that investment
of mine?” she asked gaily.</p>

<p>But he could see the anxiety in her eyes. The woman
he loved was poor, with that gnawing poverty of one who
must keep up appearances.</p>

<p>“The shares have gone up fifteen shillings,” he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“Then I have made——?”</p>

<p>“About two thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>“Can I have a check at once, for——?” Lady
Mildred stopped, and her face flushed painfully. She
hated that this man should know that she so sorely
needed the money; but poverty must sink its pride.</p>

<p>“You can have a check when you want. But I do
not want to talk business, Lady Mildred—I am a blunt
man, and I must come straight to the point. Will you
be my wife?”</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed eagerly on her face, and it required
a great effort to hide the passion that swayed him.
But he would play the game as he had planned, and
when he continued, his voice was almost devoid of expression.</p>

<p>“I am aware that you don’t love me, but I am content
to take you on your own terms. I won’t insult you by
remarking that I am a rich man. But money can be
very useful. There is your brother—and——”</p>

<p>“You wish to remind me that he is on the verge of
bankruptcy. Let us be quite frank with one another. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
suppose you know that I shall accept your offer,” she
continued very quietly.</p>

<p>“I hoped that you would.”</p>

<p>“You forget your boasted bluntness. You <em>knew</em> that
I could not refuse—I wonder that you want me. There
are many girls more beautiful, and with blood as blue
in their veins. Why do you honor me?”</p>

<p>Gaunt longed to seize her in his arms and answer the
question by fierce kisses.</p>

<p>“I have only met one woman in my life that I would
care to ask to be my wife—and that woman is yourself!”</p>

<p>His voice was low and trembled slightly, in spite of
his effort to control it. She looked at him curiously and
a smile played about her mouth. Yes, he was eminently
handsome and clean-looking, a man of whose appearance
she would never be ashamed, and yet she was conscious
of a feeling of something akin to fear. This man would
endeavor to be her master, and the idea was extremely
distasteful.</p>

<p>Prior to Gaunt’s arrival she had decided to accept him,
but now she was vaguely reluctant to do so. Were
there not rumors of the manner in which he had gained
his wealth? His connection with the Congo was enough
to damn him in the sight of most people; but on the
other hand, there was the great temptation to say “good-bye”
forever to mean poverty—to wear jewels that
would make her the envy of all her friends. And she
loved luxurious surroundings.</p>

<p>To do Lady Mildred justice, there was no man for
whom she cared, and no one would be wronged should
she accept John Gaunt. And there was her brother to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
be considered, for with the help of this millionaire, Geoffrey
would be given a fair chance—the glories of their
name might be renewed—and the Earl of Lynton take
his proper place in the world. Then, too, there
was her sister Ethel, who was not yet out of the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Gaunt watched her closely, for he realized that
she was trying to make up her mind. Not for a moment
had he imagined that she would hesitate, and he
realized how heavy the blow would be should she refuse
him.</p>

<p>Could she care for some one else? The mere idea
caused him torments, and passionate words came near
his lips. But no—he must not frighten her, for that
would be fatal to his chance; and he moved away so
that his face could not be seen.</p>

<p>“You are not going?” she cried hastily.</p>

<p>“I will stay, if you wish,” he answered very
quietly.</p>

<p>“I do wish. Mr. Gaunt, I will be your wife.”</p>

<p>In a moment he was by her side and with his eyes
fixed eagerly on her. Lady Mildred was almost frightened,
now that she had promised to give herself to him;
but she regarded him steadily.</p>

<p>“I am deeply honored.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken very quietly, and he raised
her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“I should like our marriage to take place as soon as
possible. I will see your brother to-night and arrange
about the settlements,” he continued gravely.</p>

<p>“You are very good, Mr. Gaunt—and——”</p>

<p>“Mildred, my name is John,” he suggested gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, I won’t forget it again, John. May I
say that you are a very curious kind of man. You have
never tried to make love to me—and perhaps that is
why I have consented to marry you,” she added reflectively.</p>

<p>“I hope you will like this ring.”</p>

<p>He placed it on her finger, and she looked at it reflectively.</p>

<p>“You made very certain of my answer,” she said a little
coldly.</p>

<p>“I had chosen you for my wife, and I generally get
my own way—sooner or later,” he answered, and there
was exultation in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes. I think you would. John, you would make a
bad enemy.”</p>

<p>“But a loyal friend. Even my enemies in the City—and
they are many—will tell you that I am a man of
my word. I promise that I will always be good to you,
Mildred. You shall never regret the promise that you
have just made.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you are right? Would you mind leaving
me now?” she said gently.</p>

<p>He hesitated and would have taken her in his arms
had he received the slightest encouragement, but she
merely gave him her hand, which he again raised to his
lips.</p>

<p>Late that night John Gaunt thought over the great
event of the day. His self-confidence was supreme, and
he had not the slightest doubt that in time he would win
the love of the woman who had promised to be his wife.
His passion for her had only increased by reason of its
relentless suppression, and he already looked forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the day when she would give him love for love, and kiss
for kiss.</p>

<p>And a month later John Gaunt and Lady Mildred became
man and wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A year</span> passed and John Gaunt left his house in
Park Lane to go to his office in the City. It
was a joy to him—this daily battle of wits, and
although he was as rich as mortal man could desire,
there had been no thought of giving up his work.</p>

<p>During the drive his thoughts were with his wife, for
there was naturally a little anxiety at such a time, but he
remembered that Lady Mildred was physically a strong
woman, and there was but little chance of any complication
arising.</p>

<p>His secretary, Michael Foster, rose to receive him and
placed on the table a pile of letters.</p>

<p>“I have dealt with all the rest, sir. That letter from
Brussels seems to be rather important.”</p>

<p>A frown appeared on Gaunt’s face as he read.</p>

<p>“There is no end to the sickly sentimentality of the
English. Why can’t they mind their own business and
leave the Congo to work out its own salvation?” he said
irritably.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that this will make much difference,
sir. It’s all talk, and none of the Powers dare make any
practical move. It’s England’s jealousy of Germany,
and <em>vice versa</em>, that ties their hands. But are things
really so bad as people make out?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean—are the niggers compelled to work?
If so, the answer is—yes, and the means used to make
them are severe. But then, severity is necessary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“But the cruelty and torture. I think——”</p>

<p>“Then don’t think; but if you must, pray keep your
thoughts to yourself. I will answer this letter. About
the Amanti Mine—has any cable been published yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. What time is the appointment with Weiss
and his crowd?”</p>

<p>“Eleven o’clock, sir.”</p>

<p>Gaunt glanced at the clock and then thought for a
few moments.</p>

<p>“Put out the cigars and you can go. Send them in
as soon as they arrive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Alone, John Gaunt paced restlessly to and fro, and the
expression on his face was not a pleasant one. To all
intents and purposes the foundation of his vast fortune
rested on “red rubber.” It was the Congo that had supplied
him with the capital necessary for his first financial
schemes; and the revelations of the methods employed
in that country annoyed him.</p>

<p>Punctually at the time appointed Weiss arrived. The
man was a typical German-Jew, who had made a fortune
on the Rand, and with him there came two other men
of his race. The latter were also financiers and usually
followed where Weiss led, greatly to the advantage of
their pockets.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Gaunt. There’s a cable from the
manager of the Amanti Mine just come in.”</p>

<p>Weiss’ accent was not that of the Jew of fiction and
the stage, for he spoke slowly and correctly, and it was
only by intonation that he showed his race.</p>

<p>“So it <em>has</em> arrived?” Gaunt answered quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—and we thought it would be just as well to
come to an understanding. To our joint account you
have bought about twenty thousand shares at an average
of seven and six.”</p>

<p>“That is so, Weiss.”</p>

<p>“Good. But may I point out to you that we—I and
my two friends—have no evidence that they were
bought to our joint account?” Weiss continued
suavely.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” Gaunt demanded, and there
was an ugly expression in his eyes, which the Jew did
not observe.</p>

<p>“Just a little piece of paper, setting out the facts, and
with your name to it.”</p>

<p>“So that’s your errand. Well, you won’t have it, for
I’m not quite a fool, Weiss. Let us suppose that the
sending of this cable was traced to one of your instruments.”</p>

<p>Weiss rose to his feet and gesticulated furiously.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I repeat that I am not quite a fool. I know that
this cable is a fraud. That the shares will be rushed up—are
being rushed up at the present moment—and
that we shall reap a handsome profit. You and your
friends will get your share of it. So you thought that
you could hoodwink me, did you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t admit that the cable is a fraud. But that
doesn’t matter. What concerns me is that we are entirely
in your hands. You need give us nothing, if you
don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Weiss; but you must remember that I
happen to be honest according to my lights. No man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
can say that John Gaunt ever went back on his word.
If I make a promise I carry it out. Isn’t that my reputation
in the City?”</p>

<p>“Yes—but it isn’t business,” Weiss answered grudgingly.</p>

<p>“It happens to be my way of doing business on this
occasion. I propose to sell when the shares are above a
pound, and you shall have a check directly the deal is
through. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>As soon as Weiss and his friends had gone,
Michael Foster entered carrying in his hand a slip of
paper.</p>

<p>“Amantis have risen to twelve shillings, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Let me know when they reach a pound. Are there
any more appointments this morning?”</p>

<p>“No. But Mr. George Braithwaite wishes to see
you.”</p>

<p>“Is he here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Shall I send him in?”</p>

<p>John Gaunt nodded his head and dipped his hand into
the box from which he took a big cigar. The end was
cut neatly and the match applied with great care.</p>

<p>“Well, Braithwaite, what can I do for you?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>There was a shamefaced expression on the face of the
newcomer that gave him almost a shifty look, and his
clothes showed many signs of wear.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you again, old chap; but
things are very bad. I haven’t a penny in the world
and the family are——”</p>

<p>“That is quite sufficient. You came to me a year ago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
with a similar sort of story. I gave you a hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>“You were very generous——”</p>

<p>“And I told you that it would be the last time you
got any money from me,” Gaunt said curtly.</p>

<p>“I know that; but things are really bad. There’s no
food in the house, and the wife——”</p>

<p>“I am a man of my word. Surely you should have
realized the uselessness of this call. Have you ever
known me change when I have once made up my
mind?”</p>

<p>“I am desperate, Gaunt. We are starving——”</p>

<p>There was truth in the man’s voice. The words carried
conviction with them, but Gaunt showed no sign of
weakening.</p>

<p>“I once did you a good turn,” Braithwaite said appealingly.</p>

<p>“You did—and I have repaid it many times
over.”</p>

<p>As he spoke his fingers pressed the button of the electric
bell.</p>

<p>“Foster, my private ledger.”</p>

<p>The secretary brought the book, and then disappeared
in silence.</p>

<p>“You did me a good turn—it’s quite true—and on
no less than six occasions you have come to me for assistance.
The last time I told you that it should end—have
a cigar?”</p>

<p>Braithwaite rose to his feet and his body swayed a
little.</p>

<p>“Look at that. It’s a pawn-ticket for my wife’s wedding
ring,” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t wish to be rude, but I’m really busy. I am
sorry for you but I can do nothing. You should have
understood that the last hundred pounds was the end of
my assistance. I told you so, and I am a man of my
word. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Gaunt, remember that we were boys together. You
with your millions—and I starving. You can’t refuse
me. Only a sovereign. It will buy food. Ten shillings—even
a shilling will get us bread.”</p>

<p>“Not one penny.”</p>

<p>“Curse you!” Braithwaite cried hysterically.</p>

<p>“Don’t be melodramatic—just go—for I’m busy.”</p>

<p>Gaunt felt a little regret when he was alone, but the
feeling quickly passed. The fact that he had said that
he would do no more for Braithwaite rendered anything
but refusal impossible.</p>

<p>Soon he was again interrupted by the entrance of
Foster, who announced that Amantis were still rising
steadily. Afterwards lunch was brought to his room for
he had found it impossible to eat in any public place.
His face was so well known in the City that he was
liable to be interrupted by the many people who sought
favors.</p>

<p>After the meal was over his secretary came in to announce
a visitor.</p>

<p>“The Reverend Edward Drake would like to see you,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the parson who is working in the East
End?” Gaunt asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. There is an article by him in to-day’s
<cite>Times</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Bring it to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Gaunt took the paper and rapidly scanned the column
and a half.</p>

<p>“It reads all right. Quite straightforward and no
whining. Send him in.”</p>

<p>It was with some interest that Gaunt examined the
clergyman’s face, and he was not disappointed. Clean-cut
features, noble in outline, steady eyes that regarded
one frankly. The lips firm, but rather full; and the expression
of the mouth was winning.</p>

<p>“What do you want? Money?” Gaunt demanded
bluntly.</p>

<p>“You have guessed it, Mr. Gaunt. I see you have the
<cite>Times</cite> there. If you have read my article, there is no
need to say a word. I know you are a busy man,” Mr.
Drake said with a smile.</p>

<p>While he spoke the two men were regarding one another
with overt curiosity and suddenly they both smiled.
Gaunt’s hand had gone to a drawer and he drew forth a
check-book.</p>

<p>“Will that do?” he asked, as he handed over the pink
slip of paper.</p>

<p>“You are more than generous. I am very grateful.”</p>

<p>“Show your gratitude by keeping your mouth shut.
I am not buying a baronetcy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Drake had risen. There was a flush on his face,
and he seemed to have some difficulty in speaking. Just
then a bell tinkled on the writing-table, and Gaunt took
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Yes. Put me through.”</p>

<p>He listened for a while, and his face became very white.</p>

<p>“I’ll come at once,” he said and threw down the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I must thank you most——”</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, man. My wife’s ill,” Gaunt
cried roughly, and seizing his hat, hastened from the
room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Can</span> nothing be done?” Gaunt asked in a voice
that was hoarse from the supreme effort made
to control it.</p>

<p>“We have done everything possible. The issue is out
of our hands,” Sir Felix Hellier answered, with the ever
ready sympathy which had helped him to attain so eminent
a position in his profession.</p>

<p>“Will she die?”</p>

<p>Now there was only a great despair in Gaunt’s voice.
The physician looked keenly at the famous millionaire;
noted the lines of suffering on his strong face, and wondered.
To the world, John Gaunt was a hard man, one
whose only object in life was the attainment of wealth—one
who would sacrifice ruthlessly to gain that end.</p>

<p>Twelve months ago he had surprised every one by
marrying the beauty of the season—Lady Mildred
Blythe—and the general comment was that the bridegroom
was moved by social ambition; while the bride
wished to exchange a life of aristocratic poverty for one
of unlimited wealth.</p>

<p>And now the wife lay on a bed of sickness, fighting
for her life; while the son which she had given to her
husband slumbered peacefully in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>“Can nothing be done?” Gaunt repeated hoarsely.</p>

<p>His powerful face worked painfully, and now he made
no effort to hide his distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“I am a rich man—and——”</p>

<p>“Money cannot help you. The issue is in God’s
hands,” Sir Felix said gravely, and turned towards the
door.</p>

<p>“You are not going to leave her?”</p>

<p>“I can do no more. The nurse is quite competent.”</p>

<p>“Stay and I will pay you any fee you like to ask,”
Gaunt cried passionately.</p>

<p>Sir Felix smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“There are patients who await me, and I may be able
to help them. Here I can do no more.”</p>

<p>“A thousand pounds if you will stay.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tempt me. If I could be of the slightest use I
would remain. Good-night.”</p>

<p>John Gaunt looked wildly at the door which had
been closed so quietly. Then a deep groan came
from his parched lips and he fell back heavily into an
armchair.</p>

<p>Twelve hours ago he had been so content with his lot.
Rich beyond the dreams of avarice—a beautiful wife
whom he loved—and who he believed was beginning
to care for him in return. How anxiously he had
looked forward to the birth of their child. It was
upon the coming of the babe that he had counted, to
awaken in Lady Mildred’s heart a love as passionate
as his own.</p>

<p>Now she lay a-dying, and he could do nothing to help
her. In that lay the sting. His check-book was
powerless and it seemed strange that it should be so.
If she should die—and he would never know the love
that he had sworn to arouse.</p>

<p>The issue lay in God’s hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>In God’s hands, and for years the name of the Deity
had never been on his lips, save as an imprecation. In
the piling up of his fortune, there had been no place for
religion, and he had left his youth behind him with but
one determination—to amass wealth—honestly if possible—but
to amass wealth. And he had succeeded beyond
his most sanguine dreams. There was not a financial
pie of any magnitude in which Gaunt had not a finger;
and his rivals in the city gave him their unstinted admiration.
No brain was as keen as his when the result
of a scheme meant money, and he was not the man to
allow any delicate scruple to interfere with his plans.
One principle he had—one that had helped him enormously,
for John Gaunt’s word was his bond, and if a
bargain were once made, it would be fulfilled relentlessly,
even should it result in loss. But this latter event
happened very rarely.</p>

<p>The issue lay in God’s hands.</p>

<p>Could he influence His decision? His mind went
back to the time when his mother, a gracious God-fearing
woman, was living—his mother—who had endeavored
to teach him the religion which had guided
her every action until the day of her death, when he was
some sixteen years of age. It had been her custom to
pray with him; but her influence had not lasted very
long, for Fate took Gaunt to a strange land—to the
Congo—in search of fortune, and in that country and
with that object, religion must be left at home. So the
teaching of his mother had been forgotten.</p>

<p>In God’s hands!</p>

<p>Dare he approach Him? There was still the memory
of the prayers that he had known, but there was also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
black record of the past. The scheming, the fighting,
worse than that, the deliberate robbing within the
scope of the law. He shuddered to remember the
countless ruined lives which lay behind him in the
pursuit of wealth.</p>

<p>Those terrible years on the Congo; the maiming and
torturing of human beings; the shedding of blood to acquire
wealth. With these sins on his soul could he go
down on his knees and pray God to give him the life of
the woman he loved?</p>

<p>John Gaunt was no hypocrite and he shuddered.
There was not the excuse of ignorance; for as a boy
he had gone to church and accepted God, only deliberately
to throw Him aside when Christianity would have
interfered with his ambition.</p>

<p>“I can’t go whining back to Him now I want something,”
he said miserably.</p>

<p>How still everything was! There was something
ghostly in the silence of the large library where he sat.
Above him his wife lay battling for her life, and he could
do nothing to help. Again he thought over what the
famous specialist had said and he realized that in all
human probability his wife was doomed.</p>

<p>Even now she might be dead. He rose and walked
quickly up-stairs. A distant wail from the babe greeted
his ears, and his lips were grimly pressed into a straight
line.</p>

<p>The son and heir that would cost him his beloved.</p>

<p>Very carefully he turned the handle of his wife’s
room and entered. The nurse was standing by the bed
and she came to meet him.</p>

<p>“How is she?” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“No better, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>And he stood beside the bed where his wife lay
breathing heavily. Even in that moment of agony he
was struck afresh by her great beauty. Never had she
been so dear to him, and he would willingly have
given all that he possessed in the world to keep her
with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he fell on his knees and took her burning
hand in his. The nurse moved away but he did not
heed her. His eyes were closed, and his lips moved;
but no words could be heard.</p>

<p>“I believe in God but I have put Him from my life.
I have lived for my own ends and have committed many
sins. I cannot hope that my prayer will be granted for
I have done nothing to deserve any favor at Your
hands.”</p>

<p>Formal words of prayer would not come to his unaccustomed
lips. He spoke as if he were addressing some
fellow being.</p>

<p>“But as I have done evil in my life, so I have the
power of doing good. Give me the life of my wife—give
her back to me—and I vow the rest of my days to
Your service. I will not pretend that I can become a
Christian, but I swear to You—and I keep my word—that
every action of my life shall be deliberately thought
out and shall be taken in accordance with the teaching
of Christ. I will try to right the wrongs that I have
done. Grant my request and I swear by the memory of
my mother that I will keep my side of the bargain in
the spirit and the letter. Should I be in doubt at any
time, I will go to the best Christian that I know and I
will implicitly carry out his advice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>John Gaunt rose to his feet and there was a dazed
look in his eyes. The nurse drew near and looked at
him with deep sympathy.</p>

<p>“Her breathing seems a bit easier, sir,” she whispered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">John Gaunt’s</span> eyes were fixed eagerly on his
wife and the suspense was unbearable. Yes, her
breathing did seem to be more regular. He took
the nurse almost savagely by the arm and dragged her
from the room.</p>

<p>“Tell me—is she dying?” he demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I think your wife is better. Take your
hand away. You hurt me,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“Sir Felix. Did he expect this change for the
better?”</p>

<p>“No. He thought that she would gradually get
worse.”</p>

<p>“Is there a chance that she will live?” he asked, and
his voice was tense with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>“How can I tell? I am not a doctor.”</p>

<p>“No—you’re a fool,” he said savagely.</p>

<p>He ran along the corridor and down-stairs to the
library. There he seized the telephone book and looked
up a number which he gave to the Exchange.</p>

<p>“Is that Sir Felix Hellier’s house?—Is your master
in?—Tell him that he is wanted immediately—Mr.
Gaunt, Park Lane—I will come round myself.”</p>

<p>His face worked with passion as he strode from the
room.</p>

<p>“The car at once.”</p>

<p>He gave the order to the butler and looked at his
watch. Eleven o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“So he’s not to be disturbed. We’ll soon see about
that,” he muttered as he walked up and down the hall
waiting to hear the sound of the car, and as soon as it
arrived he rushed away.</p>

<p>“62A Harley Street, as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked at his master in surprise, but at
the sight of his face he pressed in the clutch. There
was no thought of tires or police as he speeded along to
pull up with a jerk at the house. In answer to the ring
a butler appeared and Gaunt walked into the hall.</p>

<p>“I must see Sir Felix at once. It is imperative,” he
said fiercely.</p>

<p>“My master gave orders that he was not to be disturbed.
He is not well and has gone to bed. Mr. Percival
will attend to any urgent case.”</p>

<p>“Take my name up to your master.”</p>

<p>“I dare not,” the servant answered respectfully.</p>

<p>“Then stand aside.”</p>

<p>So saying Gaunt passed and ran up the stairs. When
he reached the landing he called forth.</p>

<p>“Sir Felix.”</p>

<p>All was silent save for the heavy breathing of the
butler who had followed, under the impression that he
had to deal with a lunatic.</p>

<p>“Which is your master’s room?” Gaunt demanded
roughly.</p>

<p>“Who is there? What’s the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>A door had opened and Sir Felix, clothed in a dressing-gown,
appeared.</p>

<p>“It is John Gaunt. You must come at once. The
nurse says that my wife is better.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, you forget yourself, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“I only remember that you are my wife’s doctor.
She needs you, and you must come.”</p>

<p>“You are acting very strangely. I left instructions
that Mr. Percival should attend to any pressing cases.”</p>

<p>“Sir Felix, you will come back with me at once.
You told me that you could do no more. You said the
issue was in God’s hands. I believe that He has decided
the issue. But I am taking no risks. You may be able
to help, and must come with me.”</p>

<p>“I think you cannot quite be responsible for what you
are saying. I am not used to——”</p>

<p>Gaunt almost pushed him back into his room.</p>

<p>“Get your clothes on and don’t talk. I won’t leave
this spot until you promise to accompany me. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>The look of anger left Sir Felix’s face and he smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>“That’s better. If my wife lives, there’s a blank
check, which you can fill in for any amount,” Gaunt
continued eagerly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were seated in the car and
the rapid pace made Sir Felix utter an ejaculation.</p>

<p>“Is this quite safe?” he said deprecatingly.</p>

<p>There was no answer for hope had surged to Gaunt’s
heart and he could only think of what the next few
hours would bring forth.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you had better come in with me. You
shall know, at the earliest possible moment,” Sir Felix
said suavely, when they reached the door of the bedroom.</p>

<p>“I shall be in the library.”</p>

<p>And there Gaunt went. An abstemious man—he
poured out half a tumbler of neat brandy, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
gulped down. His hands trembled as he endeavored to
light a cigar.</p>

<p>The moments passed, oh, so slowly, and his agitation
increased. What would be the verdict? Death, and with
it the vanishing of all life’s sweetness. Life—and—his
wife.</p>

<p>How long it was he knew not, but at last Sir Felix
entered.</p>

<p>“Lady Mildred has taken a turn for the better.”</p>

<p>“She will live?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say yet, but there is hope. Why don’t you
lie down and rest? It may be an hour or two before I
can tell you definitely.”</p>

<p>“Rest—what do you think I’m made of? Have you
any idea what my wife means to me?” Gaunt asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Still I think you should rest. You have evidently
been enduring a great strain,” Sir Felix persisted gently.</p>

<p>“Go back to her, and I will await your verdict.”</p>

<p>“Your wife has a wonderful constitution. Ninety-nine
out of a hundred women would have already succumbed.”</p>

<p>Sir Felix cast a curious look at the bowed head of the
millionaire and went back to his patient. The nurse was
standing by the side of the bed and holding a spoon to
Lady Mildred’s lips.</p>

<p>“She has recovered consciousness, sir,” she whispered.</p>

<p>The eyes of the sick woman followed the doctor as he
approached, and her lips moved.</p>

<p>“My baby.”</p>

<p>“Fetch the child, nurse.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, I thought I was dead—am I dying?”</p>

<p>“No—not if you want to live. It rests with yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The sound of a cry—not feeble, but almost shrill, and
that wonderful “mother-look” came into Lady Mildred’s
eyes. The baby was placed by her side, and as it nestled
to her breast, she sighed.</p>

<p>“I shall not die—with this——”</p>

<p>The words, little more than a whisper, could scarcely be
heard. The nurse held her breath and bent down to her
patient, while Sir Felix’s fingers rested on Lady Mildred’s
pulse, and it was evident that he, too, was full of anxiety.</p>

<p>“My little baby.”</p>

<p>Her breathing now was more regular, and the faintest
tinge of color came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“She is asleep,” the nurse whispered triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>Neither of them moved, and the pulsations told their
tale to the physician. It was a long time that they
waited, and at last Sir Felix withdrew his hand. And
now his thoughts were of the husband. Only too well
did he know the reputation of John Gaunt—heartless in
his pursuit of fortune—and yet he must love this woman
to distraction. The world, too, had its opinion of Lady
Mildred. Her life, until a month or two ago, had been
that of the ultra-fashionable woman of to-day. Apparently
thoughtless of everything save the extraction of
every possible enjoyment from each moment of her life.
What was there in her to arouse so great a passion in such
a man as John Gaunt? True she was very beautiful, but
that in itself was not sufficient to account for such a
love.</p>

<p>“The man behaved like a madman,” he muttered to
himself.</p>

<p>Should he go down and relieve him of his anxiety?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
No. This time there should be no mistake, and he would
wait until he could be absolutely certain.</p>

<p>In the meantime John Gaunt was pacing restlessly to
and fro. Deep lines had appeared on his face, and his
eyes were strained. The stronger a man’s character, the
greater his capacity for suffering, and Gaunt was a strong
man. As the minutes passed his agitation lessened—not
that he suffered any the less acutely—but his mind had
become dazed.</p>

<p>He thought over each event of the day. His actions
in the City, and he vividly remembered his interview with
Braithwaite. Had the man succeeded in obtaining
money, or was his family still without food? Not that he
felt any greater sympathy for him—he only wondered.</p>

<p>Then the deal in Amanti shares, and he muttered an
exclamation of anger when he remembered that he had
forgotten to leave instructions with Foster.</p>

<p>“Surely he will have the sense to realize,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Yes. That was a smart piece of business, and would
net in a few thousands.</p>

<p>Then came the visit from the parson. He was glad
that he had been generous, and he smiled wanly at the
memory of his abrupt departure. What agony he had
suffered as he hastened home—what hours of torture
which had culminated in that moment when he had knelt
by his wife’s side.</p>

<p>He, John Gaunt, had prayed. Every word that he had
said was burnt into his brain.</p>

<p>“<em>Give me the life of my wife, and I vow the rest of my
life to Your service. Every action of my life shall be
deliberately thought out, and shall be in accordance with
the teaching of Christ.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>He trembled when he remembered the words, and a
feeling of awe overwhelmed him as he realized what he
had promised. The trembling increased until it reached
every limb, and his step was a stagger as he endeavored
to reach a chair into which he fell back heavily.</p>

<p>“I have made a bargain with God,” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>It was immediately after he had risen from his knees
that the nurse had told him that his wife seemed to be a
little better. Was that an answer to his prayer? Had
the bargain been ratified from above?</p>

<p>To John Gaunt the silence of the room seemed death-like.
He tried to moisten his parched lips and then suddenly
leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>“What was that sound?”</p>

<p>The handle of the door turned, and Sir Felix appeared;
a reassuring smile on his face.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I am happy to tell you that your wife is
out of danger.”</p>

<p>Gaunt staggered, fell back and clutched wildly at the
chair. Sir Felix ran to the table and brought a glass of
brandy.</p>

<p>“Drink this. Ah! That’s better. Now you must
go to bed. A good sleep and you will be all right.”</p>

<p>Still Gaunt did not speak. His eyes had a vacant look
and his lips were tremulous.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sir Felix. Don’t stay any longer. It
was good of you to come. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Take my advice and go to bed. Good-night,” Sir
Felix said drily.</p>

<p>John Gaunt never knew how long he rested there
motionless, save for the twitching of his limbs. There
was much to be thought out. His wife would live.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
God had decided the issue, and now there was his own
side of the bargain to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>His quick mind told him what the vow meant—the
upheaval of his life—the changing of everything—“red
rubber” must go—the Amanti deal—everything
must be different.</p>

<p>Could he carry out what he had promised—honestly,
and completely?</p>

<p>Suddenly his face cleared and he rose. There was
a steady light in his eyes and his lips were pressed
firmly together.</p>

<p>“God has kept His side of the bargain, and, by
Heaven, I’ll keep mine,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>At last he slowly made his way up-stairs and paused
at the door of the room where his wife lay. Sir Felix
had been mistaken in saying that she would die,
so might he not be equally mistaken in his judgment
that she would live? As he entered the nurse looked at
him, a sympathetic smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a sound, sir. She is sleeping so peacefully,”
she whispered.</p>

<p>He stood by the side of the bed and he was reassured,
for the change was wonderful. At her breast the child
lay, and the sight brought a choking sensation to his
throat. This atom of humanity was their child—his
son and hers. Now there was no doubt in his mind that
Lady Mildred would love him, and in time, as passionately
as he loved her. How strenuously he had fought
to win her. With what care he had considered his
every action towards her. And the result had been
negative. Each overture had been received with a smile
and deftly turned aside. Since their wedding day there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
had been no frankness between them. Perhaps Lady
Mildred had discovered the intensity of his feeling
towards her, and was half afraid of it.</p>

<p>The baby moved restlessly and in an instant the nurse
had taken it up, and was hurrying into the next room.</p>

<p>“Please don’t take him away.”</p>

<p>Lady Mildred had awakened and she spoke appealingly
to the nurse.</p>

<p>“Very well, my lady. But you mustn’t let him disturb
you.”</p>

<p>“He won’t trouble me,” Lady Mildred answered
softly, as the child once more nestled to her breast.</p>

<p>Then for the first time she realized that her husband
was present, and a faint tinge of color came to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a dear?” she whispered, and he bent over
and reverently touched her forehead with his lips.</p>

<p>“You must not talk,” the nurse said firmly.</p>

<p>“Just a few words more,” Lady Mildred said, and her
eyes were fixed on her husband.</p>

<p>Gaunt gave a little gasp at what he saw in them.
There was something akin to love, and he bent down
eagerly to hear what she was about to say.</p>

<p>“I thought I was dying, John. I imagined that my
soul had left my body when you came and took me by
the hand—it was you, John; and yet you were very
different. Don’t laugh at me, dear, but it almost seemed
as though an angel were by my side. Your face was very
beautiful, and your eyes shone with a strange light.
And as you held my hand I felt that I was not dead, but
that I must struggle to live. Your lips moved and uttered
strange words of prayer. I struggled to live, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
then—I can remember no more. But wasn’t it a funny
dream? Just think of it—John Gaunt an angel!” she
whispered whimsically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I must ask you to leave the room at
once. It is essential that my patient should rest,” the
nurse said severely.</p>

<p>“Run away, dear. I want to get well,” and Lady Mildred
turned to her baby.</p>

<p>Gaunt once more kissed his wife, and then, with a sense
of awe, his son.</p>

<p>His step was buoyant as he walked to his room. His
valet, drowsy-eyed, rose to perform his nightly duties,
but was summarily dismissed. But Gaunt had no wish
for bed, for he knew only too well that sleep was far
away. There was so much to be thought over—the
wonderful love that he had seen in his wife’s eyes, and a
few hours ago he had imagined that she was lost to him.
A shudder shook him at the memory of it, and then his
mind naturally turned to the vow that he had made.
Now that his was relieved of immediate anxiety about
Lady Mildred, he had time to think what it really meant.</p>

<p>He had promised that every action of his life should
be in keeping with the teachings of Christ. There could
be no shuffling from the issue, for a solemn bargain had
been made. God had fulfilled His part, and the rest remained
with himself. A grim smile twitched at his
mouth as he began to understand the revolution to which
he was bound. Slowly memory was returning and his
thoughts went back to his boyhood.</p>

<p>The teaching of one’s youth is never really forgotten.
It may lie dormant for years, but even in old age it will
return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>At fourteen years of age religion had been a very real
thing to him, thanks to his mother’s influence, and he
had striven to follow her teaching. He could remember
that his nightly prayer was not merely the formal utterance
of words, but was the expression of what was truly
in his mind. Yes; as a boy he had honestly endeavored
to lead a Christian life, and he had been neither a prig
nor a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And for the last fifteen years his every thought had
been of self. His only guide had been ambition, and its
accompanying desire for wealth.</p>

<p>The brain has an odd way of turning to subjects that
are out of keeping with one’s frame of mind, and Gaunt
found himself wondering if Foster had sold the Amanti
shares, and if the price had been a suitable one.</p>

<p>Why had those shares been bought? Because of his
knowledge of the fraud.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that if he intended to keep
his vow, it was not possible for him to participate in such
profits.</p>

<p>And thus it was brought acutely to his mind what his
future life must be, unless he would perjure himself.</p>

<p>A follower of Christ in the City, and he laughed discordantly
at the idea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Reverend Edward Drake lived in the East
End of London. Although in Holy Orders,
he held no living, nor yet a curacy; but busied
himself in doing good according to his own ideas. His
study was the only room in the house that was properly
furnished, and on its walls were displayed many athletic
trophies, which he had won at Oxford.</p>

<p>The chair in which he sat bore signs of wear, and
might have been a legacy from his undergraduate days.
The pipe, which was gripped by even white teeth, was
charred and battered, and was evidently an old friend.</p>

<p>The remains of a substantial breakfast lay on the table,
and Drake quickly read the letters of the morning.
When he had finished, his old housekeeper brought him
a note which had just been delivered by a messenger.</p>

<p>It was from John Gaunt, and asked for an appointment
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>“<em>I am quite willing to come to you, but should you be
near the West End to-day, I shall be glad if you will
call. Perhaps you will lunch with me.</em>”</p>

<p>“The man is very polite. I wonder what he wants?”
he muttered.</p>

<p>It was but yesterday that he had been to Gaunt’s office,
when he had received a check for so unexpectedly
large an amount. Although they had been together but
a few minutes, he was intensely interested in the millionaire.
For one thing, he had been unable to fix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Gaunt in his proper place. He could not decide
whether his predominant traits were good or evil and
he longed for an opportunity to find out. It was natural
that he should imagine what untold good could be done
by a man with the power of millions in his hands. As a
matter of fact, during his return from the City to the
East End, Drake had been dreaming dreams. He had
been planning what he would do if he were the possessor
of such wealth, and the problem proved to be fascinating
in the extreme.</p>

<p>After a little consideration he decided to lunch with
Gaunt, and so scribbled a note to that effect which he
gave to the messenger. Then he started on his morning’s
work with whole-hearted energy. It was a pitiful
task, for he had devoted his life to the submerged—to
those victims of misfortune and incompetence or laziness,
or drink, who dragged out their weary existence in hidden
corners and out of sight.</p>

<p>First he would try to give them a little physical
strength by feeding them, and then to give them an opportunity
of making another effort to regain their foothold
on life. It was marvellous how successful he had
been, although at times despondency held him in its
grip. But now, thanks to Gaunt’s generosity, he would
be able to enlarge the scope of his work, and carry out
many new schemes.</p>

<p>To his astonishment a luxurious motor-car pulled up
before his house, which he found had been sent by
Gaunt to take him to Park Lane. A smile lit up his
face as he sank back against the comfortable cushions,
for his rather shabby attire was strangely out of keeping
with such magnificence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>A crowd of urchins had gathered round, and they
gave a wild cheer when he started. Drake looked back
and gaily waved his hand.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I were out on the spree,” he said aloud.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?” the chauffeur said politely.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. What a very fine car you drive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’s a sixty horse Magnus,” the man answered
proudly, and then proceeded to tell the numerous
good points <em>his</em> car possessed over every other in the
market.</p>

<p>Drake listened with a pleased smile, for he was enjoying
himself immensely.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I might sit in front with you?” he remarked
ingratiatingly, and the chauffeur put on the
brake. “I like to watch you working the pedals.”</p>

<p>But Drake sighed a little when the car stopped before
the Gaunt palace, as though his holiday had come to an
end. But it was not so, for lunch was ready, and the
millionaire and himself were alone. How dainty everything
was! Not too much magnificence for comfort.
Then the food and the wine. Drake was no gourmet,
but he liked his meals to be nicely cooked and would always
prefer a bottle of beer to a cheap claret.</p>

<p>“I suppose this wine is very expensive,” he said reflectively,
and then blushed furiously as he realized the
bad taste of his remark. “Forgive me, Mr. Gaunt, but I
so seldom eat with any one that I fear I get in the habit
of talking to myself.”</p>

<p>Gaunt smiled, for he was beginning to feel a liking for
Edward Drake. There had been a little doubt when he
had sent the letter, but the doubt had quickly disappeared
now that they had been together for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Do you smoke?” Gaunt asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is my one extravagance,” Drake replied.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the library, Gaunt went to a
cabinet, and from it chose one of the cigars which he
kept for himself and his most intimate friends. Drake
snipped off the end and carefully applied a match.
Then he threw himself back into the chair and took two
or three luxurious puffs.</p>

<p>“It is almost worth while being a millionaire,” he remarked
meditatively.</p>

<p>“May I send you a box?” Gaunt asked politely.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I couldn’t think of accepting such a
gift. No—no. I must be content with my pipe. But
you are very generous, and I thank you.”</p>

<p>Gaunt knew that it would be useless to insist, and he
respected Drake the more for his decision. He too lit a
cigar and brought his chair near the other one.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, I don’t quite know how to begin,” he
said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Take your own time.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that you will think me a trifle mad when
you hear what I have to say. First I want you to answer
me a question—and frankly. Will you do so?”</p>

<p>“To the best of my ability,” Drake answered gravely,
for he recognized that Gaunt was grimly in earnest.</p>

<p>“Why did you come to me for a check? From what
you knew of my character, did you think you were likely
to get one?” Gaunt asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“My experience tells me that checks are often obtained
from the most unlikely quarters.”</p>

<p>“Then you considered me an unlikely quarter?
Frankly, what have you heard about me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“You wish me to tell you—frankly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gaunt cried impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’ve not heard much to your credit. They say you
aren’t too particular about the way you make money—so
long as you make it. Then your connection with
‘red rubber’ does not predispose people in your favor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve always heard that you are a man to be
trusted. You hold a promise to be a sacred thing, and
that is something nowadays. Since yesterday, I can
place generosity to your credit, and now that I know you
personally, I am inclined to think that you have not allowed
the world to see your true character. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“God only knows what my real character is. At any
rate rumor hasn’t lied, I’ve been a thorough bad lot—how
bad, I am only just beginning to realize.”</p>

<p>Gaunt paused, and the two men looked at one another
in silence.</p>

<p>“I would like to be your friend, and help you in any
way that is in my power,” Drake said quietly.</p>

<p>“That’s why I sent for you. I want your help, and
you’re the only parson I’ve met in whom I should care
to confide. I believe that you are a man—a man of
God, and such a one can help me.”</p>

<p>Again Gaunt paused, and it might have been thought
that he was nervous.</p>

<p>“I am a priest, and anything you may say will be
held as spoken in confidence,” Drake said earnestly.</p>

<p>“When I left you yesterday so hurriedly, I came here;
and Sir Felix Hellier told me that my wife was dying. I
cannot describe to you my sufferings, for she is very
dear to me. For a while I was in the deepest despair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
and had given up all hope. I am no Christian, Mr.
Drake. I have not allowed religion to influence me one
iota; but I remembered the teaching of my childhood,
and as the last resource of desperation, I prayed.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and Drake
realized that he was deeply affected.</p>

<p>“I offered God a bargain—in return for my wife’s
life I promised that I would endeavor to act as a Christian
and that each action of my life should be dictated
by the teachings of Christ.”</p>

<p>Drake started up in his chair, and his hands tightly
clutched the arms. There was an expression of extreme
wonderment on his face.</p>

<p>“Your wife is living—and——”</p>

<p>“Yes. My wife will live. Almost immediately afterwards
she took a turn for the better,” Gaunt answered
quietly.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence, and Drake lived each second
of it. His eyes were fixed keenly on Gaunt’s face,
and he could see nothing ignoble there. It was strong,
but could human man carry out such a vow? He
wanted to speak but dared not. Like a flash it was revealed
to him what a great issue was at stake. Should
this millionaire be honest enough to carry out his vow,
untold good would result. But his hope fell instantly.
Such a man as Gaunt—who had lived as he had lived,
could not revolutionize his character by the mere making
of a vow. To keep such a bargain was an impossibility—and—yet——</p>

<p>Yes. There was a steady look on Gaunt’s face. He
did not flinch, but had the air of one who was weighted
with a great burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Why have you told me that?” Drake demanded
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I haven’t yet finished. I went further than I have
said, for I vowed to right the wrongs that I have done.
Just imagine what that means. It’s a Herculean task,”
Gaunt said with a laugh that contained no mirth.</p>

<p>“Still I do not quite understand why you send for
me,” Drake said quietly.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t know what to do, and I want your
advice.”</p>

<p>“You intend to carry out the promise you made to
God, not merely in the letter, but in the spirit?”</p>

<p>“I intend to keep my promise, and at the time, I made
no reservations. I understood what I was saying and I
consider my wife’s life worth any sacrifice,” Gaunt answered
doggedly.</p>

<p>Drake did not speak but gave the millionaire a searching
look. His brain was working at high pressure, for
he realized that Gaunt was serious in his intention of
performing his vow.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you have any conception of the magnitude
of your undertaking?” he asked very quietly.</p>

<p>“I am just beginning to catch a glimpse of it. As I
have already told you I am not a Christian, but I have
some idea of the meaning of religion. I realize that I
shall have to regard everything from a different point of
view, and I fear that the task is beyond me. That’s
where you come in.”</p>

<p>“Still I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“It’s simple enough. I’m going to make you my
conscience. You know exactly what I have got to do,
and it will be your duty to see that I do it. I can foresee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
many situations which will require delicate judgment,
but I have confidence in you. I now formally offer you
the post of private chaplain to John Gaunt, millionaire,
at any salary which you like to name. It strikes me
that the post will be no sinecure,” Gaunt wound up
quickly.</p>

<p>A look of distress came into Drake’s face.</p>

<p>“I cannot accept such a position. The responsibility
would be too great.”</p>

<p>“Think a moment. Remember the power for good
that will rest in your hands. Dare you refuse my offer?”</p>

<p>“It is such a vast thing. To right the wrongs that
you have done. How can you contemplate the task so
calmly? Do you forget the origin of your fortune? Do
you forget the Congo?—with its cruelty and torture?”</p>

<p>“I forget nothing. What I have promised I will endeavor
to carry out,” Gaunt said quietly, but his face had
grown very white.</p>

<p>“It may be your duty to use your millions to fight
the rulers of the Congo—to compel them to make the
iniquities cease? Do you realize that and can you carry
it out?”</p>

<p>“Yes. To know me thoroughly, Drake, you must
understand that I don’t value my wealth one jot, save for
the power it gives me.”</p>

<p>“I believe the man is in earnest,” Drake muttered,
and he gazed at Gaunt with something akin to admiration.
“Will you give me a day to think over the proposal?”
he continued aloud. “I don’t like to take up a
thing like this without careful consideration. But if my
answer is ‘yes,’ you may be sure that I will not look
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“I am quite willing.”</p>

<p>“But I must say at once that I can accept no salary.
Fortunately I have an income of a few pounds a week
that obviates the necessity. I am glad of it, for I shall
feel more comfortable—if I accept your offer.”</p>

<p>“You must please yourself. So long as you say ‘yes’
I shall not grumble. Now let us leave the subject until
you have made up your mind. You will find me at the
office to-morrow morning. No—don’t light that cigar
again. Let me give you another one.”</p>

<p>Drake took it, and was about to strike a match when
the door opened, and a girl rushed in.</p>

<p>“John, I have just left Mildred. Let me congratulate
you both. The baby is a dear,” she said brightly.</p>

<p>“Ethel, may I introduce to you Mr. Drake, a clergyman
who I hope will be our domestic chaplain. Mr.
Drake, this is my sister-in-law, Lady Ethel Blythe,”
Gaunt said with a grim smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lady Ethel Blythe</span> was some five years
younger than her sister, and had not yet
formally entered society. It was only recently
that she had returned from France where she had received
her education, and had since been staying with
relations in the country, until she had received news of
the birth of her sister’s child. That morning she had
arrived in Park Lane, and it was the first time that she
had met John Gaunt since the wedding.</p>

<p>“I did not know there was any one with you—and
may I ask why you are about to start a chaplain? I
was not aware that you were religiously inclined, John,”
she said mischievously. Her manner was quite self-possessed
and she bestowed a curious look on Edward
Drake.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt is speaking of what is not yet settled,”
the latter said with an air of embarrassment, which was
not lost to Lady Ethel’s keen eyes.</p>

<p>“If I have interrupted you, I will go. That wretched
nurse has forbidden me the room. She says that I excite
the patient too much.”</p>

<p>She moved towards the door but Gaunt called her
back.</p>

<p>“We have quite finished our little talk, and will be
glad if you will give us some tea,” he said politely.</p>

<p>Drake glanced hastily at his watch and uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“I had no idea it was so late. It is after four o’clock,”
he cried in surprise.</p>

<p>“You must manage to spare a few more minutes. I
will ring for tea at once,” Lady Ethel said peremptorily.</p>

<p>Drake followed her with his eyes, and her beauty was
a revelation to him.</p>

<p>A woman always knows when she has aroused a man’s
interest, and when Lady Ethel returned there was a mischievous
smile on her face. It must be remembered that
she was little more than a girl, and had not fully realized
the power that beauty gives to a woman, but she saw
that this good-looking clergyman liked her.</p>

<p>“Will your chaplaincy necessitate your residence with
us?” she asked gravely.</p>

<p>So Lady Ethel lived with the Gaunts, and Drake made
a mental note of the fact.</p>

<p>“We have not yet discussed that,” he replied with
equal gravity.</p>

<p>“I should much prefer that it should be so,” Gaunt
broke in decidedly. “It would give me a much safer
feeling, to have my confessor at hand.”</p>

<p>“John, have you become a Roman Catholic? How
interesting!” Lady Ethel cried.</p>

<p>“I belong to the Church of England,” Drake answered
shortly, and he gave Gaunt a warning glance.</p>

<p>There ensued a light conversation between Lady
Ethel and Drake to which Gaunt listened and from
which he obtained a little amusement.</p>

<p>“Decidedly my sister-in-law is a flirt, and the parson
will be an easy victim. Well, it’s his lookout, and he
must take care of himself,” was his thought.</p>

<p>At last Drake took his leave, and it was arranged that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
he should call at Gaunt’s office in the morning. Lady
Ethel was very gracious as she bade him good-bye, and
when the door had closed she turned to her brother-in-law
with an air of innocent triumph.</p>

<p>“I hope I made a good impression on your friend. I
tried my best,” she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You must have mercy, Ethel. I forbid you to make
him fall in love with you.”</p>

<p>“He seems very nice for a parson, and he’s quite
good-looking. I like him,” she said emphatically.</p>

<p>Gaunt smiled indulgently as she chattered away, but
he was going over in his mind the recent interview with
Drake. There could be no doubt of the gravity of the
task he had undertaken, and he contemplated it with
disquietude, but not for a moment did he weaken in his
resolve.</p>

<p>“You are not listening to me, and I shall leave you,”
Ethel cried with simulated anger.</p>

<p>“I am going up to see Mildred—that is, if she’s
awake. You had better not go near her again. You
talk too much, child,” he said drily.</p>

<p>When Gaunt reached the hall, Sir Felix Hellier was
descending the stairs, and so he waited for him.</p>

<p>“How is my wife?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“She is much better, and you may be quite easy in
your mind. It is a wonderful recovery,” Sir Felix answered
with some complacency.</p>

<p>“Would you mind coming into this room for a moment?
I want to ask you a question.”</p>

<p>Gaunt led the way and there were obvious signs of
nervousness when he faced the doctor.</p>

<p>“You remember when you left my wife yesterday, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
mean on the first occasion, when you told me that you
had done all you could, and that the issue lay in God’s
hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sir Felix said impatiently.</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me frankly—when you left, did
you think that she was dying?” Gaunt asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I thought that the case was hopeless. Of course, the
best of us are liable to make mistakes, but I am of opinion
that it is something in the nature of a miracle that Lady
Mildred is alive,” Sir Felix answered gravely.</p>

<p>“Do doctors often make such mistakes?”</p>

<p>Sir Felix flushed at the question, but he quickly saw
that Gaunt had no intention of being impertinent.</p>

<p>“I tell you frankly that in my opinion your wife ought
to be dead. Upon my soul, I don’t understand why she
is alive,” Sir Felix answered irritably, and it would almost
appear from his manner that Lady Mildred had
committed an offense in living.</p>

<p>“Then your science is at fault,” Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>“In this case—yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sir Felix. One thing more. I owe you
an apology for the unceremonious way in which I fetched
you here last night.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t refer to it. Under the circumstances, your
conduct was quite excusable. Good-bye for the present.
I shall look in again to-night,” Sir Felix said, a trifle
pompously.</p>

<p>Gaunt was deeply moved by the doctor’s answers. It
was quite evident that Sir Felix could not understand
Lady Mildred’s recovery, and from that moment John
Gaunt became convinced that he owed his wife’s life to
the prayer that he had uttered. Residence amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
natives of West Africa does not make one less superstitious,
and when among them he had seen strange things
that apparently could not be explained by the ordinary
rules of life.</p>

<p>So now it was upon him to carry out his side of the
bargain. His face was very grave when he entered his
wife’s room. Lady Mildred was awake, and her face
brightened when she saw him.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he simply sweet?” she whispered, and drew
aside the clothes so that he should obtain a better view of
the baby.</p>

<p>In answer Gaunt kissed her gently on the forehead,
for he could not trust himself to speak, and he moved
away. There had been such a terrible fear that his wife
would go back to her old manner, and he was relieved to
find that there was a tender love in her eyes and she
seemed unfeignedly glad to see him.</p>

<p>“I thought that I had lost you,” he blurted out suddenly.</p>

<p>“Poor John. You must have had a terrible time.
But it’s all right now, and I intend to get well as soon as
possible.” She paused a while. “I don’t think I have
been quite fair to you in the past, dear. But never mind,
I will make up for it in the future,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Do you mean——?”</p>

<p>He did not complete the question, but she understood,
and a vivid flush came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I think I have been very selfish, dear. This little
one has already opened my eyes to many things. Shall
we go for a long cruise in the yacht and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will give orders at once and we’ll start as soon
as you are strong enough,” he broke in impetuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. It will be delightful. Just you and I and the
baby.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she began to laugh very quietly, and the
nurse came hurrying up.</p>

<p>“You must not excite her ladyship. I think you had
better go,” she said severely to Gaunt.</p>

<p>“No, it’s all right, nurse. I will be good,” Lady Mildred
cried. “But I was thinking of my dream. Of you as an
angel, John. It was too funny for words. You don’t
seem to see the joke?”</p>

<p>John’s face had grown whiter for he was once more
living through the terrible hours of yesterday. This
strange dream of his wife’s went a long way to confirm
him in the belief that he owed her life to God’s intervention.
Therefore he would fulfill his vow completely and
honestly and at any cost to himself.</p>

<p>But would his wife help him in his endeavor? It was
too absurd for consideration, for if he were to tell her of
his determination she would laugh the idea to scorn.
Lady Mildred’s guiding motive in life was her own enjoyment,
and nothing else.</p>

<p>True, she did go to church, but her visits were very
rare, and then only for the sake of appearances. No,
Gaunt could expect no sympathy from that quarter—in
fact he would probably meet with opposition.</p>

<p>It was evident that his future actions would be likely
to excite comment among both his friends and enemies.
With the latter it would be easy to deal, but friends
have an unfortunate knack of claiming explanations as a
right.</p>

<p>“You are very serious, John,” said Lady Mildred, and
Gaunt was recalled to the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>It was sufficient for the moment to know that his wife
regarded him very differently.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I think you are beginning to care for me,”
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>In answer her hand moved towards him and lay there;
but she did not speak.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Edward Drake</span> walked the whole way back
from Park Lane to Whitechapel. He was one of
the many men whose brains work more quickly
when the limbs are in motion, and he had much to occupy
his thoughts. At first sight it seemed ludicrous to
imagine that Gaunt would fulfill a resolution made under
such circumstances. The issue was stupendous, and
would change his life in every detail if it were carried out
conscientiously. But although he had known Gaunt for
a short time, he had come to the conclusion that Gaunt
was a man of no ordinary character. Most men would
have calmly forgotten their promise, and it was to his
credit that he had remembered it seriously. In addition,
Gaunt had sent for him, and had made a proposal in
a quiet businesslike manner. Therefore to all appearances
he had decided to keep his side of the bargain.</p>

<p>Before he had reached home Drake had decided that
Gaunt’s offer was honestly meant, and that it was not
merely a salve to his conscience, to be thrown aside at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>There were people waiting in his house, and it was
typical of the man that he at once started work, and for
the time, dismissed from his mind the subject that had
been engrossing him. It was late before he had finished,
and after supper he settled himself comfortably before
the fire, for the purpose of thoroughly thrashing out the
problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Curiously enough he imagined that he could see in
the brightly burning coals a face, and it was not that of
Gaunt, but of Lady Ethel. A smile twitched at his
mouth for it was pleasant to remember so radiant a
young beauty. Of women Drake knew nothing, for as
a youth he had been too shy to enjoy their company;
and the shyness had only vanished after he had become
acquainted with so many real tragedies of life. One
who lives habitually in the midst of intense human
suffering must naturally lose all consciousness of self.</p>

<p>He found it quite an effort to banish the memory of
her from his mind, and to concentrate his thoughts upon
the problem before him.</p>

<p>It was true that Edward Drake was a Priest in Holy
Orders, but above all he was a Christian and to him
creeds were of little value. It was his honest endeavor
to live as he believed Christ would have him live.</p>

<p>His ambition was to do the greatest amount of good
to the greatest number of people in the time that was at
his disposal. His work in the East End was of benefit to
many, but he believed that there were others who could
carry it on as efficiently as himself. Therefore he was
in no way tied to it. Having settled this to his own
satisfaction, the next question concerned the seriousness
of the intentions of John Gaunt. If the millionaire
meant what he had said at their interview, there could
be no doubt that it was his duty to help him to carry
out his intentions to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>It was not only John Gaunt’s honor to be considered,
but the power and influence of his millions. With such
wealth behind him there was no limit to the benefits
which might be conferred on the poor and suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Drake’s face grew very grave when he remembered the
one subject that was wont to fire him with the fiercest
indignation—the Congo Free State—and the abominable
atrocities that were being committed there.</p>

<p>John Gaunt’s wealth was founded on the tortured
labor of the natives of West Africa, and John Gaunt had
vowed to right the wrongs that he had committed.</p>

<p>Drake jumped up and began to pace restlessly to and
fro.</p>

<p>“I will be this man’s servant. I will endeavor to
direct him in the way he should go,” he said, and his
voice was filled with a grim resolve.</p>

<p>He knelt beside the chair and prayed for guidance,
and when he rose to his feet there was a glad light in his
eyes. It was the face of a born fighter—a face ablaze
with enthusiasm for a good cause. And now his only
fear was that John Gaunt would not have the strength to
fulfill his vow. But his fears grew less when he remembered
the impression that the millionaire had made upon
him.</p>

<p>When he awakened in the morning, it was with the
feeling that something good had happened, and he
rushed through his work as quickly as possible. It was
twelve o’clock when he reached Gaunt’s office, and as
soon as he arrived he was conducted into the private
office. Gaunt rose to receive him, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Have you decided?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I am your man. But first I would
ask you one question. Have you thoroughly weighed
the consequences? Are you prepared to go through
with it at any cost?” Drake asked earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“I intend to keep my promise,” Gaunt answered
doggedly. “I am beginning to appreciate that the
thing is even bigger than I had imagined. What is it,
Foster?” he asked irritably of his secretary who had
brought to him a slip of paper.</p>

<p>“Ah—Mr. Weiss. Ask him in,” he said when he
had glanced at the name.</p>

<p>“Will you see him while this gentleman is here?”
Foster asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Gaunt rejoined curtly, and then turned to
Drake.</p>

<p>“I think this will be the first example of what I shall
have to put up with. Listen to what we say, and Weiss
will probably make things clear to you. I had better
warn you that personally I come out of this business
rather badly,” he wound up with a grim smile.</p>

<p>Weiss entered, and his face bore an affable smile.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Gaunt, I think we’ve done pretty fair out
of that deal. What price did you get?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s no use beating about the bush, Weiss, but I
don’t think you are going to get one penny piece out of
the Amanti profits. It all depends upon this gentleman’s
decision when he has heard the facts,” Gaunt said
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Weiss started to his feet, his face ablaze with indignation
and fear.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about this gentleman. I
know I want a check, and I’m going to have it, unless
you’ve turned thief,” he cried furiously.</p>

<p>“Listen to me and I will explain,” Gaunt answered
suavely, and he exchanged a significant look with
Drake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“A short time ago,” Gaunt continued quietly, “Mr.
Weiss and his two friends came to me and suggested a
deal in Amantis. At the outset I suspected that there
was something wrong, for neither of those gentlemen is
a philanthropist, and if all had been straightforward,
there was no reason to ask me to participate in their
scheme. As a matter of fact, it had been arranged that
a forged cable should be sent from the mines announcing
a fresh and valuable discovery of gold—and we were to
take our profits on the rise which would naturally ensue.
This has been done, and I reckon that about twenty odd
thousand pounds have been cleared. Do I make myself
quite clear, Drake?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how our business concerns this gentleman,”
Weiss cried truculently. “Give me the check and
let me go.”</p>

<p>“Have I made a fair statement of the case?” asked
Gaunt.</p>

<p>Edward Drake was watching the scene with keen interest,
and he was wondering what Gaunt would decide
to do. It was quite clear that this enormous profit had
been procured by fraud, and this would be a test of the
strength of the Vow.</p>

<p>Weiss was beside himself with rage and amazement so
that for a while he was incapable of speech, but soon he
grew calmer and told himself reassuringly that this was
but a joke that was being played upon him.</p>

<p>“Look here, Gaunt; this has gone far enough. You
know that my time is valuable and I want to get off.
Just calculate our share and let me have a check like a
good fellow,” he said with a cheerfulness that he was
far from feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t intend to keep the profits, neither do I intend
that you shall touch one penny piece of them. Look
in to-morrow’s <cite>Times</cite> and you will see an announcement
that will interest you,” Gaunt said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Now Weiss realized that it was no pleasantry and
his voice became loud and there was menace in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Very well, Gaunt. It’s no use discussing it further
just now, but I’ll just say that if I don’t get a check in
the course of a week, I’ll make things pretty hot for you.
It seems to me that you are not yourself this morning,
and it’s only fair to give you a little time for consideration.
I can be a dangerous enemy as you’ll find out.
Good-day. Come along,” he said to his friends, and
they followed him obediently.</p>

<p>Drake drew a deep breath when they had gone but
made no remark, although there was an inquiring expression
in his eyes that brought a smile to Gaunt’s
face. The latter touched the bell, and Foster entered,
note-book in hand.</p>

<p>“Take down this letter,” he said sharply. “‘To the
secretary of the King’s Hospital Fund—I have pleasure
in enclosing a check for twenty’—let me see, what are
the exact figures?—‘twenty-nine thousand, three hundred
and fifty pounds for the benefit of the Fund. This
is a gift from Mr. Julian Weiss and two friends, and I
shall esteem it a favor if you will acknowledge the receipt
of same in to-morrow’s issue of the <cite>Times</cite>. I do
not wish my own name to appear in the matter.’ Have
that typed at once and send it off by hand. How will
that do?” Gaunt asked turning to Drake.</p>

<p>“It seems to be one way out of the difficulty—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
what about the holders of the shares who have sold on
the strength of the forged cable? Surely they ought to
be considered?” Drake said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Ah—that didn’t occur to me. But still, I’ll send
the check off. I promised Weiss something interesting
in the <cite>Times</cite> to-morrow and he shall have it. As to the
owners of the shares, I’ll instruct the brokers to offer
them back at the price they sold to me, but I’m afraid
that they will think me mad,” Gaunt said ruefully.</p>

<p>But there was a smile on his face when he rose.</p>

<p>“I am rather enjoying this experience—up to the
present. But enough of business for to-day. Come
with me to Park Lane, and we’ll have a long talk after
lunch. I want your advice on many matters. By the
bye, I hope you have decided to reside with us?” Gaunt
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes—but not until I have got everything into
working order at home.”</p>

<p>“How long will that take?”</p>

<p>“About a week, but for some time to come I must
continue to visit the East End,” Drake answered, and
then suddenly burst into a fit of hearty laughter.</p>

<p>“What amuses you?” Gaunt asked drily.</p>

<p>“Only the memory of Mr. Weiss’s face. I am afraid
that he received a terrible shock.”</p>

<p>“Which to-morrow’s announcement will intensify.
By the bye, what do you think of me now? You must
realize that I was a participator in a fraud, and had it
not been for this Vow, I should have taken my share of
the ‘swag.’ Don’t try to mince matters, and if the discovery
has made any difference do not hesitate to say
so,” Gaunt said grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Drake did not answer for a moment and his expression
was very grave.</p>

<p>“I never imagined that you were a saint, neither had
I thought you capable of an act which amounts to pure
and simple theft. You see I am speaking frankly, but
still I think you are serious in your intention to perform
your vow; therefore everything of the kind in the future
becomes impossible,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you look at it in that way, for
there’s much worse in store. That is if I am to do the
thing conscientiously. To begin with there’s the Congo,
and I intend to tell you the truth—the truth,” Gaunt
repeated emphatically.</p>

<p>Drake shuddered and some of the color left his face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was the first time that Lady Mildred had left her
room since the birth of her child and she was lying
on the couch which had been drawn close to the
fire. Her sister, Lady Ethel, was standing by her side
and regarding her with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand this husband of yours, for
he doesn’t live up to his reputation. I have been with
you for a fortnight and my eyes have not been shut, my
dear. I always understood that John was a very modern
financier, but from what I have seen he might be in
training for a parson,” Lady Ethel said laughingly.</p>

<p>“John is not an easy man to understand, but I have
never noticed any tendency towards religion,” Lady Mildred
answered.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that Mr. Drake—a clergyman
from the East End—takes up his residence here to-day?”</p>

<p>“John did mention that some one was coming to stay
with us, but surely he does not intend that the parson
should be a fixture?” Lady Mildred said with a frown.</p>

<p>“That’s what I gather, and I’m quite sure that there’s
some mystery about. Your worthy husband and Mr.
Drake are always talking together in the library, and
when I make an appearance, the subject, whatever it
is, is quickly dropped.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is this Mr. Drake?” Lady Mildred
asked musingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right, for he doesn’t thrust religion down
your throat. In fact, I’m always forgetting he’s in the
Church and I’m afraid that at times he’s rather shocked
by some of my remarks. But I like him.”</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and a nurse entered,
carrying in her arms the baby. “Let me have him. I’ll
be very careful,” Lady Ethel cried eagerly.</p>

<p>With great gentleness she took the sleeping child and
sat down on the couch beside her sister, while the nurse,
at a nod from her mistress, left the room.</p>

<p>The young girl, radiantly beautiful, crooned a lullaby
and she did not hear the door open to admit John Gaunt
and Edward Drake.</p>

<p>“May we come in, Mildred?” the former asked quietly,
and his wife smiled in reply. “This is Mr. Drake,”
Gaunt continued. “I want you to like him.”</p>

<p>She looked up and her eyes quickly scrutinized this
new friend of her husband, and the examination apparently
satisfied her, for she held out her hand and spoke
graciously.</p>

<p>“I am glad to know you, Mr. Drake. My sister was
just speaking of you.”</p>

<p>Drake longed to know what Lady Ethel had said, and
he was aware that there was mischief in the latter’s eyes,
as he murmured his thanks to Lady Mildred for her
welcome.</p>

<p>“You must not stay up too long, dear,” Gaunt said
anxiously, and Lady Mildred flushed slightly at the concern
in his voice.</p>

<p>During these last few days a feeling of embarrassment
had sprung up between husband and wife, and there
had been no intimate talk between them. Lady Mildred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
was conscious of a shyness in Gaunt’s presence that
she could not understand while he was determined to
take no risks, but to be patient until he was absolutely
certain of the state of her feelings towards him.</p>

<p>“Have you given orders to get the yacht ready?”
Lady Mildred asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Not yet, for I find that I sha’n’t be able to leave
England for a month or two,” he answered hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Of course, if your business is so pressing, I should
not think of asking you to make any sacrifice,” she answered,
but he could see that she was hurt by his reply.</p>

<p>But it was one of the disabilities of the fulfillment of his
vow, that he could not leave England until many things
had been done, and when he spoke his tone was apologetic.</p>

<p>“My hands are tied for a while. I have no choice,
Mildred, or I would not hesitate to go at once. If you
wish, the yacht shall be got ready and you can take your
sister with you for company until I can join you.”</p>

<p>“You are very good, but I don’t think that I am very
keen on going. After all it would have been rather dull—just
you and I,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel took the baby back to the nurse and a few
moments later Drake excused himself with the plea that
he would finish his unpacking.</p>

<p>“Why have you brought that man to live with us?”
Lady Mildred asked when she was alone with her husband.</p>

<p>“I like him,” Gaunt answered emphatically.</p>

<p>“Yes. But that is not an answer to my question.”</p>

<p>“Have you any objection? If so, I can very quickly
alter the arrangement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“No. I don’t wish that. You have the right to ask
any friend you wish to your house.”</p>

<p>“If you dislike the idea, I will——”</p>

<p>“No—no. You misunderstand me,” she interrupted
him hastily. “I was only thinking that it was a little
strange that you should make a clergyman a member of
our family. I have never noticed that you were religiously
inclined,” she wound up drily.</p>

<p>“Mildred, dear, will you be patient with me? It is
my intention to make a great change in my life, and I
want your help and sympathy.”</p>

<p>A look of surprise swept over her face.</p>

<p>“Surely you haven’t lost all your money, or anything
dreadful of that kind?” she cried.</p>

<p>“No. But even if I had, you would be quite safe.
Your settlement was a quarter of a million, and that can
never be touched,” he answered grimly.</p>

<p>“May I ask the reason of the change you propose?”</p>

<p>“First of all, I shall give up business in the City. As
soon as possible I shall retire from all the companies in
which I am interested, and shall invest my capital in gilt
edged securities that are easily realized. But a great
deal of this capital I intend to use, and it is probable that
in a few months’ time I shall be only a moderately
wealthy man.”</p>

<p>Lady Mildred had listened with eager attention, and
was evidently very puzzled by the announcement.</p>

<p>“It is certain that you can do as you like with your
money. As you say, I and the child are provided for by
the settlement,” she remarked frigidly.</p>

<p>Gaunt was silent and there was a hesitating look in his
eyes for he was wondering if it were possible to tell his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
wife of the vow that he had made; but it was certain that
she would not understand, and so the idea was quickly
abandoned.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I had hoped that we were going to be better
friends,” he said impulsively.</p>

<p>“Is that possible, John? I think we are a model
couple for I cannot remember that we have ever quarrelled,”
she answered nervously.</p>

<p>“I wish that you cared for me sufficiently—to
quarrel. I sometimes wonder if you suspect how much
I love you. A few days ago—when you were so
ill—I imagined that, that you loved me even as I love
you.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I am afraid that you are growing sentimental.
Really, John, you are full of surprises. Of
course I love you.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and his were filled with so great a
passion that she grew afraid and rose quickly.</p>

<p>“I am very tired, and the doctor said that I must not
overdo it. I think I will retire,” she said hastily.</p>

<p>Gaunt proffered his arm and together they walked in
silence to her room, at the door of which she dismissed
him with a smile. He went to the library, and sat down
to think over what had taken place. It was certain that
Lady Mildred had been hurt by his refusal to set off on
the yacht at once, and he cursed the necessity of refusal,
but there was no alternative if he was to keep faith.</p>

<p>These last few days had revealed to him some of the
difficulties that lay before him, and for the moment he
was dismayed, but it was typical of the man that there
was not even a temptation to turn aside from the course
that he had mapped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>His reverie was interrupted by the entrance of Drake
and Lady Ethel, both of whom were in the best of spirits,
for they were chatting together gaily and it seemed to
Gaunt that the man whom he now called his father confessor
was enjoying himself thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, I will play you a hundred up,” said Lady
Ethel.</p>

<p>“I can’t play billiards,” Drake replied ruefully.</p>

<p>“Then it’s time you learned and I will teach you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted,” he answered.</p>

<p>Gaunt looked after him, and then called out.</p>

<p>“Drake, I want to have a long chat after dinner, so
please don’t make any promise to amuse this young
lady,” he said drily.</p>

<p>A slight flush came to Drake’s face as he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“I shall be at your service, Mr. Gaunt.”</p>

<p>And Lady Ethel threw him a glance that was full of
mischief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> footman brought the coffee which he placed
on a table between the chairs on which Gaunt
and Drake were seated and then withdrew
silently. Neither of them spoke but their faces bore an
expression of great gravity, for they realized that they
were about to discuss a question of vast importance, and
that this discussion was likely to be a momentous one.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is the Congo?” Drake at last ventured
to say.</p>

<p>“Yes—compared with that, all my other sins are
light. To fulfill my promise I must try to remedy the
state of affairs that I helped to bring into existence,”
Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>“I know a good deal of its history, but I wish that you
would tell me something from the inside. I want to be
able to understand from your point of view,” Drake answered.</p>

<p>“It’s a gruesome subject, but I will do as you ask. It
is only within the last few years that Europe has begun
to grasp a little of the truth—of the infamies, of the
murderings and torturings that have been committed in
the name of civilization. I must go back to the commencement,
and I will admit that when the late King of
the Belgians entered into the agreement with Stanley to
represent him in making treaties with the natives, he had
no intention of exploiting the country in the way he did.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
King Leopold gained the consent of Europe and the
United States to forming the Congo Free State with the
plea that he wished to develop the country for the good
of its inhabitants. In fact he termed himself a philanthropist
and promised that the natives should be his first
consideration. And so in 1884 the Congo Free State
was formed under the benign auspices of the Great
Powers of the world—England and America being especially
interested. For some years—until 1891—these
promises were more or less faithfully carried out, and the
country was developed, the natives being paid for the
work they did. But the Belgians are not born colonizers,
and the financial position became desperate. King Leopold
had sunk fifty thousand pounds of his own money,
and in those days he was not a rich man. I suppose it is
unnecessary for me to refer to the late King’s private life,
to his licentiousness, to his extravagance, to his——”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Drake broke in hurriedly. “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De mortuis
nil</i>——”</p>

<p>“That maxim may apply in ordinary cases, but to one
with the crimes that lay on the soul of King Leopold——”</p>

<p>Gaunt broke off with a shrug of the shoulders, and
lapsed into silence. His eyes were moody and Drake
thought he could detect something of shame in their expression.</p>

<p>“An Englishman—the late Colonel North—invested
a large sum in one of the companies formed to exploit
the rubber trade and that was my first connection with
the Congo. I went out there determined to amass
wealth, and I arrived just about the time that King Leopold
was beginning to discover that he owned a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
gold mine. Hitherto the natives had been paid for the
rubber which they collected, but it occurred to his Majesty
that such a payment was unnecessary. Accordingly
he appropriated the land, the produce of the soil,
and the labor of the people—in spite of the promises to
the great powers of Europe. It was but natural that the
natives would not submit to such robbery without a
struggle, and so the Congo raised a vast army of natives
to carry out this policy.”</p>

<p>Drake was deeply interested, and his eyes were fixed
eagerly on Gaunt.</p>

<p>“I will only tell you what I saw with my own eyes,”
the latter continued. “I was sent to the Mongalla district.
I arrived at the house of the chief of the post and
I noticed a little crowd gathered in front of it. A
woman was strung up to a post, and a huge native was
flogging her with a weapon they called the <em>chicotte</em>—a
whip of rhinoceros hide that cuts deeply into the flesh.
A white man was counting monotonously and he had
reached the number one hundred and ninety. He
stopped when he saw me, but the native continued to
strike. ‘What is the matter?’ I cried. The officer
looked at me in surprise. ‘She is the wife of a chief
who won’t bring in his rubber,’ he replied. I looked at
the woman, and she was dead.”</p>

<p>Drake shuddered, and his face had grown very white.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you interfere?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“What could I do? I was out there to make money,
and use soon accustomed me to such sights. I won’t go
into details, but will merely say that human life and suffering
were held as naught. The orders were that so
much rubber must be sent down the river, and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
way to get the natives to collect it was by the fear of
death and torture.”</p>

<p>“Had you a direct hand in this business?” Drake
asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No—but I profited by the method in which the
rubber was obtained. I don’t want to harrow your feelings,
but I tell you that every pound of rubber that has
come from the Congo has been and is being produced
by the wholesale murdering and torturing of the natives,”
Gaunt said solemnly.</p>

<p>“You use the present tense. Surely now that the
Congo has been taken over by Belgium, things are better?”</p>

<p>“Not one whit—and they never will be better so
long as a Belgian remains in power.”</p>

<p>“But the new King. He is of good repute, and——”</p>

<p>“The new King will not have the slightest power to
alter the conditions. Years of rapine and murder have
reduced the Congo to such a state that the present
methods must continue. The alternative is bankruptcy,”
Gaunt answered.</p>

<p>There was horror on Drake’s face, and his lips were
pressed into a straight line.</p>

<p>“When the Belgian government took over the
Congo,” Gaunt continued, “they gave a pledge that the
condition of the natives should be improved immediately.
I have means of obtaining information of what is really
taking place, and I saw that they have no intention of relinquishing
their methods of obtaining rubber by murder
and torture. But they have promised to open the Congo
to the trade of the world in three stages. That is, they
have divided the country into three portions. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
is to be opened out in a few months, but I may say that
that portion is one that has already been devastated by
murder and the land has been depleted of its one valuable
product—namely, rubber. A year later a second
portion is to be thrown open—by that time it will be in
the same state as the first.”</p>

<p>“It is dastardly,” Drake broke in angrily.</p>

<p>“No date has been given as to the opening out of the
third portion—and for a good reason—the country is
practically untouched, and they propose first to exhaust
it by their usual methods. When the country has been
drained dry—when the Belgians have earned their millions,
then, and not till then, will they admit the foreigner.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say seriously that now—at this
moment, the Belgians are collecting rubber in the same
way as they did in the past?” Drake asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>Gaunt nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Yes. They think it is a simple matter to fool
Europe as they have done in the past. There are companies
with a capital of a few thousands that pay an annual
dividend of a quarter of a million pounds. You can
readily understand how it is done. Their labor costs them
nothing, and every native has to work six days out of
the seven to bring in his allotted weight of rubber. If he
fails he is flogged to death and his family is imprisoned.
Thousands of women have been flogged and starved, because
their men have not been able to bring in the required
quantity of rubber.”</p>

<p>“And this is the twentieth century—it seems incredible!”</p>

<p>“But the state of things has been proved by innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
trustworthy witnesses. It is strange to me that the
British people have not been fired by the hearing of such
atrocities. I suppose the Congo is too remote a country,”
Gaunt said reflectively.</p>

<p>Drake had risen and began to pace rapidly to and fro.
His brow was puckered into a frown and it was evident
that he was deeply moved.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that we have ever <em>really</em> realized it.
These poor innocent natives, butchered in cold blood,
and all for the sake of gold. And they are white people
as ourselves who reap the profit from this slavery.”</p>

<p>“Their condition is worse than slavery,” Gaunt said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Can nothing be done? Are we quite helpless?”
Drake cried passionately.</p>

<p>There was no reply and there was something akin to
contempt in the look that he gave Gaunt.</p>

<p>“You are a rich man, and you say that your wealth
was founded on this base traffic. You are in the confidence
of these monsters who are wringing gold by
murder and torture—can you think of no remedy?” he
cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“It is a difficult question. Europe is too busy with its
own affairs to concern itself. Righteous England has
only been able to talk and threaten and has been afraid
of deeds. Belgium has taken advantage of this, and has
calmly gone its own way, secure in the knowledge that
we should confine ourselves to words.”</p>

<p>“But there must be some way of helping these poor
people,” Drake said desperately.</p>

<p>“If you can suggest anything I shall be glad to listen
to you. I appreciate that it is my duty to do all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
lies in my power. I place myself in your hands,
Drake——”</p>

<p>“It is an awful responsibility. But I will find a way.
This talk with you has brought the grim reality before
my eyes. I shall know no rest until we attempt something
to help. At this moment innocent people are
being done to death. It is infamous.”</p>

<p>“There is no alternative while the present people have
power. Unless they force the natives to work rubber
will cease to come in. The people are broken and the
land devastated to such an extent that it will take generations
to recover. If the Congo is to be governed
equitably, it will be necessary to sink millions in the
country instead of draining them out. No, Drake, the
position is hopeless so long as the Belgians rule the
Congo.”</p>

<p>“I will not believe it. There must be some remedy
for such a heart-breaking state of affairs. No punishment
would be too great for the men who have perpetrated
this crime.”</p>

<p>Gaunt did not speak but concentrated all his attention
on the fresh cigar he had taken from the box.</p>

<p>“Are you with me heart and soul? Would you
make any sacrifice to help this downtrodden people?”
Drake asked, and now he spoke quietly and calmly.</p>

<p>“I repeat that I am in your hands,” Gaunt replied.</p>

<p>“God will help me to find a way.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken confidently and the two men
stared at one another steadily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A fortnight</span> passed and Gaunt made no further
effort to arrive at an understanding with
his wife. They met but seldom, and always in
the presence of Edward Drake or Lady Ethel, so that
he came to the conclusion that Lady Mildred was
desirous of avoiding any intimate conversation with him,
and in this supposition he was right.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Lady Mildred was unsettled in
mind, and did not quite know what she herself wished.
It must be remembered that love had never touched her
heart, and she much preferred to keep her feelings well
in hand, for she imagined that to care for a man deeply
would cause her more discomfort than pleasure.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred was physically strong and she had
completely recovered her health; in fact motherhood
had added to her beauty, for it had given a gentler
expression to her face and had banished a great deal of
the coldness that had been there. A drive in the park
had brought a fresh color to her cheeks so that when
she reëntered the house, her sister looked at her with
undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I am only just beginning to realize how
very beautiful you are,” Lady Ethel remarked. “I am
not surprised that your husband adores you so openly.”</p>

<p>Lady Mildred made no reply but took off her coat
and turned away her face so that her sister should not
see the flush that had come to her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Will you ring for tea?” she said quietly.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel laughed slightly as she touched the button
of the bell, and there was still a smile on her face when
she took a seat by the side of her sister.</p>

<p>“I think you are a very lucky woman and ought to be
very happy—but I don’t think you are, Mildred,”
she remarked frankly.</p>

<p>“Are you not just a little impertinent?” Lady Mildred
said coldly.</p>

<p>“No. Only curious, which is the prerogative of
youth. I quite like this husband of yours, although
when I first saw him at the wedding, I thought him
rather hateful, and wondered how you could marry him.”</p>

<p>“You forget that John is a rich man,” Lady Mildred
said bitterly.</p>

<p>“No. I don’t forget, for I am quite sure that you
would never have married for money alone. I have
been watching you two rather closely of late and sometimes
I think you care for him much more than you will
allow any one to see.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she looked steadily at her sister, and
was pleased to see that her words were not without
effect, for Lady Mildred was very angry.</p>

<p>“You talk like a sentimental schoolgirl. You
imagine love to be the most important thing in the
world.”</p>

<p>“So it is, my dear, and you’ll find it out some day.
Let me give you a little sisterly advice. John is by no
means an ordinary man, and I warn you that he may be
driven too far. Perhaps you won’t know his real worth
until you lose him. As I said before, I have been keeping
my eyes open and it is very evident that your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
husband is in trouble of some kind. I wonder you don’t
speak to him frankly and offer to share it. You would
be received with open arms,” Lady Ethel said with
unwonted seriousness.</p>

<p>“If John has worries, I am ready to help him to the
best of my ability.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell him so?”</p>

<p>“It is not my place to ask for his confidence. You
really are going too far, Ethel. I think I will rest till
dinner time,” she said wearily.</p>

<p>But when she reached her room Lady Mildred made
no attempt to sleep, for she was strangely disturbed;
instinct told her that there was a good deal of truth in
what Lady Ethel had said.</p>

<p>Did she love her husband? The question could not
be answered readily, although she realized that her feelings
towards him were very different to what they were
at the time of their marriage.</p>

<p>Before she began to dress for dinner, a visit was paid
to the nursery and she took the baby in her arms and
pressed it closely to her breast. Its eyes were open and
it struck her very forcibly that the child was more like
her husband than herself, and she was conscious of a twinge
of jealousy, but the feeling quickly passed and again she
remembered John Gaunt’s never varying kindness. Did
she love him?</p>

<p>Her lips reverently touched the baby and she turned
away with a sigh. As she slowly dressed, a determination
was born—a determination to give her husband a
chance, and to allow him to approach more closely to her.</p>

<p>During dinner Gaunt was very quiet but as soon as
the meal was over he rose from the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Drake and I have an engagement—if you will
excuse us,” he announced quietly.</p>

<p>“Is it important? I rather wanted to talk to you,”
Lady Mildred answered with unwonted tenderness.</p>

<p>“I am sorry. It is a meeting about the Congo,
and——”</p>

<p>“Will you take me with you?” Lady Ethel broke in
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to listen to a recital of horrors?” he
asked brusquely.</p>

<p>“I should like to go. I am interested in the Congo,”
she answered.</p>

<p>“I, too, would like to go,” Lady Mildred said, and the
two men were surprised at the announcement.</p>

<p>“I think you would be wiser to stay at home,” Drake
said nervously.</p>

<p>“I wish to go,” Lady Mildred rejoined coldly.</p>

<p>Gaunt shrugged his shoulders and made no further
objection, but he was very silent during the drive to the
hall, where the meeting was to take place. They
entered a building that was packed from gallery to floor
and on the platform were many well-known faces. The
Archbishop of Canterbury was the chairman and he was
supported by the heads of the free churches, while
notabilities from every branch of life were present to add
weight to the protest against the crime of the Congo.</p>

<p>Eloquent words were spoken—words that deeply
stirred the hearts of the vast crowd as they listened to
the description of the sufferings of a people who were
powerless to help themselves. Then a manifesto was
read which had been issued and signed by every well-known
divine in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Twenty-five years ago we sanctioned the formation
of the so-called ‘Congo Free State,’ on the ground of its
being a ‘humane and benevolent enterprise.’ We invoked
the divine blessing upon an undertaking which
was intended to work to the benefit of the inhabitants of
the country. To speak of those hopes as falsified
is to use too mild a term. The basin of the Congo
is to-day the scene of as cruel a tyranny as exists on
earth.”</p>

<p>Lady Mildred listened with the deepest interest. Like
the great mass of the British people she had read something
of the state of affairs, but no lasting impression
had been left on her mind. But the eloquent words to
which she listened brought the whole cruel tragedy
vividly before her mind.</p>

<p>John Gaunt had founded his fortune on “red rubber,”
and John Gaunt was her husband.</p>

<p>Her eyes happened to rest on his face and she saw
that he was very pale—what were his thoughts of this
scathing indictment of a nation? She dared not think.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, John?” she whispered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>A speaker had just sat down, and Gaunt was making
his way rapidly to the platform which he quietly mounted
and turned to face the audience.</p>

<p>“I am John Gaunt and I wish to speak,” he said in a
clear ringing voice.</p>

<p>A murmur arose, and the chairman whispered to those
near him.</p>

<p>What could this millionaire wish to say to them?
This man whose gold had the taint of blood.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred’s breath came quickly and the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
seemed interminable as she waited for her husband to
continue his speech.</p>

<p>Edward Drake watched the scene with a feeling of
intense excitement, for he had no idea what Gaunt was
about to say. It was but a few hours ago that the subject
of their presence had been discussed. The meeting
had attracted a good deal of attention and it chanced
that during the afternoon, Drake was reading an article
in the <em>Times</em> when Gaunt entered the library.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I think that the time has come for
action,” Drake cried eagerly. “Have you read this
leader about the Congo?”</p>

<p>“I have just glanced at it. Isn’t there a meeting of
some sort to-night?” was the careless answer.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think you ought to be present. A fortnight
has passed and we have done nothing,” Drake
replied energetically.</p>

<p>“What do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“This meeting is intended as a weighty protest against
the inaction of the English government. The speakers
are eminent men and there can be no question about
their disinterestedness. If such a man as yourself raised
a voice, the effect would be increased a thousandfold.”</p>

<p>“You mean because of my connection with the
Congo?” Gaunt asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. The public more or less connect you with the
Congo Free State, and if you were to relate your experience,
it would have an enormous influence for good.
During these years while a war has been raged against
this iniquitous rule the burden has rested on the shoulders
of one man—the secretary of the Congo Republic
Convention. He has pluckily fought a battle with public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
apathy, but little can be done without funds. You
have said that you are prepared to spend your wealth in
righting the wrongs which you have committed. In
what better way can you do so than by joining hands
with those who are strenuously endeavoring to obtain
justice for the natives of the Congo?” Drake said
earnestly.</p>

<p>“There is something in what you say, but have you
thought how such an action would affect me personally?
My Belgian friends will say I have ‘ratted,’ while if I tell
the brutal truth my English friends will call me a blackguard,
and refuse to associate with me. You must remember
that the Belgians have always denied that any
atrocities have been committed.”</p>

<p>“The statement by you will remove every doubt,”
Drake cried impetuously.</p>

<p>“It is rather a large order to ask me to do this. I
think you know that if I do undertake it, I shall not
mince matters,” Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>“So much the better. Under the circumstances I do
not think that you have the right to consider yourself
personally. You have led me to believe that you are
honest in your determination to fulfil your vow. If this
is true, you cannot hesitate for a moment.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand your point of view, but I must
own that I had not anticipated any such public action
as you suggest.”</p>

<p>“Do you honestly wish to help the natives of the
Congo?” Drake cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“I haven’t considered them—I am only thinking of
myself,” Gaunt answered drily. “Perhaps you will be
quiet for a few minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Drake watched him eagerly, and when the minutes
passed he grew despondent for he recognized that he had
set a difficult task, and one that would require courage
of a high order to carry out.</p>

<p>“Surely I was not mistaken in this man,” he told himself
hopefully.</p>

<p>Gaunt rose and crossed over to a cabinet from which
he took a cigar. Still he did not speak and the silence
continued for some time.</p>

<p>“You are not going to draw back?” Drake cried in
desperation.</p>

<p>“No. I will accompany you to the meeting.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! And you will bear witness to——”</p>

<p>“I will make no promise,” Gaunt interrupted him
quietly.</p>

<p>Drake possessed tact and he recognized that it was not
the moment to apply pressure. If a decision had been
arrived at, nothing he could now say would change it,
and he must possess his soul in patience.</p>

<p>The fact that Lady Mildred and her sister were to accompany
them disturbed him greatly, for it was but natural
to think that their presence might cause Gaunt to
modify any statement that he intended to make.</p>

<p>But Drake did not yet fully understand the character
of John Gaunt.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> the last two weeks Gaunt had been
working hard in the City and had made arrangements
for relinquishing his active life.
Tempting propositions had been brought to him but
they had been firmly refused, and the general impression
was that he had made sufficient money to satisfy even
his requirements and was about to retire.</p>

<p>There was no attempt to disguise from himself that
the chief matter with which he must deal was the Congo,
and he brought all his intellect to bear on the problem
before him. But the difficulties seemed well-nigh insurmountable.</p>

<p>Now that he knew his position, it was characteristic
that he would not discuss the matter with Drake until he
could see daylight. The suggestion that he should
speak at the meeting was distasteful in the extreme, but
finally he decided that refusal was impossible.</p>

<p>When he faced the thousands of tense faces he was calm
and collected.</p>

<p>“Have I your Grace’s permission to speak?” he asked
of the Archbishop.</p>

<p>The latter rose and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“My lords, ladies and gentlemen. Most of you know
the name of John Gaunt, and I feel sure that you will be
interested in one who must have unique knowledge of
the subject we are discussing,” he said, and resumed his
seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“I thank your Grace, and promise that I will detain
you for but a few moments. I have listened attentively
to all that you have said and I tell you that the condition
of affairs in the Congo has not been exaggerated. I
do not intend to shock you with horrors, but with my
own eyes I have seen men, women and even children
murdered in cold blood, maimed and tortured.”</p>

<p>He paused, for a hoarse murmur had arisen so that it
was a few minutes before he could continue.</p>

<p>“I admit that I myself have made money through
labor which has been procured by these means. My
wealth is founded on the ‘red rubber’ which has come
from the Congo. I tell you this so that you shall know
I am quite honest in what I am about to say, for I shall
speak against my own pecuniary interests. You have
been discussing the effects of the annexation of the
Congo by the Belgian government, and some of you
have expressed the hope that matters may be improved
thereby.”</p>

<p>He paused, and the silence was intense.</p>

<p>“Your hopes are doomed to disappointment. There
can be no improvement in the conditions, for any
improvement would necessitate the abandonment of
the slavery which exists. I said slavery—but it is
hardly the right word, for in modern history slavery has
not meant work forced by the fear of death or torture.
Wherever the late King held active sway, there the
country was laid waste by the sword, and rubber was
produced not with any idea of the future but solely for
immediate gold. The abandonment of the present
system can only be accomplished by the abandonment
of the Congo by the Belgians. That they will not do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
unless compelled by superior force. Their present
budget anticipates a profit of nearly a million pounds.
If the land and produce of the soil be returned to the
rightful owners—the natives—then, instead of a profit,
there would necessarily be a heavy deficit. When the
Congo budget provides for a deficit and not a huge
profit, then and not till then will you know that the
natives are about to receive fair treatment. That will
occur only when the country has been drained dry. If
you hear that a portion of the country has been opened
to the foreigner, you will know that that portion is
worthless, for the population will either have been killed
or have fled from the fear of death, and the produce will
have been exhausted.”</p>

<p>This statement made a profound impression, and all
anxiously waited for Gaunt to continue.</p>

<p>“You are seeking the amelioration of the natives.
To accomplish this you must remove the present
officials. There must be no half measures and I am
convinced that no amount of talk will have the slightest
effect. Actions and not words are required, and it is for
you to see that England does more than talk. A single
gunboat at the mouth of the river would affect a change,
while diplomatic representations will be swept aside as
has been done in the past. Surely England is strong
enough to act alone—or is it fear of Germany that ties
her hands? If this be the case, it is not the spirit that
won our empire, and as a race we are doomed. Let
there be no more hesitation, let each of you use his influence
and bring pressure to bear upon our government.”</p>

<p>“We have already done everything in our power,” a
bishop interrupted vehemently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Then I fear that the reform of the Congo is impossible.
But let us make an effort. I am a rich man—rich,
largely through the Congo—but, if money is
necessary, I am prepared to spend every penny piece of
it on this work. More than that, I now publicly
announce that from this moment I am the enemy of the
governors of the Congo. Any ability that I possess
shall be used to affect reform.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur which developed into loud
cheers, and there was a look of defiance in Gaunt’s eyes
as he listened.</p>

<p>“My lords, I feel that I owe you some personal
explanation. You must have viewed my appearance
here with mingled feelings, for I am aware that I am
looked upon as one of the strongest supporters of the
present régime. You all know the name of Edward
Drake, who has done such good work in the East End
of London, and I refer you to him should you have any
doubt as to the honesty of my intentions. It is owing
to his influence that I am here to-night.”</p>

<p>Gaunt paused for a moment and the Archbishop rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>“I am sure that we have listened to Mr. Gaunt’s statement
with profound interest. From one point alone
what he has said is invaluable. His evidence will
remove every shadow of doubt as to the atrocities that
have been and are taking place in the Congo. I must
own frankly that I looked always upon him as one of
our bitterest enemies. I have been ashamed to think
that an Englishman could have profited by cruelty and
torture. Surely God must have brought him here
to-night. We must all admire the courage with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
he has spoken. It was no light thing to face us and
frankly admit the sins of the past, and I honor him for
what he has done. He has taken the only course open
to a Christian, for he has promised to do his utmost to
right the wrongs in which he has been a participator.
Before Mr. Gaunt resumes his seat, I should like to ask
him one question. Naturally he is in touch with the
rulers of the Congo—would it not be possible for him
to use his influence with them, to bring pressure to bear
upon them that they should govern the natives equitably?”</p>

<p>The Archbishop resumed his seat and Gaunt continued:</p>

<p>“No personal influence or pressure would effect any
change. There is only one effective weapon—force.
The position of England has caused a good deal of
cynical amusement in the Congo. The British government
would only move if so great a feeling were aroused
in this country that they dared not do otherwise. Much
has been done in recent years by meetings and writings
in the press; but the Congo is so far away that the truth
has never been driven home. The question of Tariff
Reform or Free Trade can rouse fierce passions, for the
principle touches our pocket; but that thousands of
human beings should suffer torture—that is a thing to
read and be harrowed about—but a cup-tie is of much
more immediate importance. Perhaps I am unjust to
my fellow countrymen, for at times they have been
aroused to white fury by the story of oppression and
murder. Witness the Armenian atrocities. But then
there was a great man with a silver tongue who could
move a nation by his words. And the only chance for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the people of the Congo is that such a man should rise
again and tear from us our complacency. Make the
British people understand that they have been cleverly
swindled. The late King played the confidence trick
upon America and the great powers of Europe. He
deliberately hoodwinked them with his tongue in his
cheek. But King Leopold was a master ‘crook.’ He
was a born diplomat of the most unscrupulous type; and
to his dying day he was a match for every foreign
secretary that crossed swords with him. And he has
left worthy lieutenants behind. I dare prophesy that we
shall again receive the most specious promises that
reform will take place at once—say in a month or two;
but the date will always be a few months ahead until
they have drained every grain of gold from this most
unhappy country. Again I say that I am prepared to
spend my last penny in helping you in your work.”</p>

<p>John Gaunt bowed and then stepped down from the
platform. His face was set as he walked straight to the
place where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Where is my wife?” he asked of Drake who sat
alone.</p>

<p>“She went away with Lady Ethel about five minutes
ago,” Drake answered, and his eyes were shining luminously
as they rested on Gaunt.</p>

<p>“I think we had better follow them. Come along,”
the latter said curtly.</p>

<p>And all eyes were fixed on Gaunt’s face as he strode
from the hall. When he drew near the door a cheer
arose which gathered in volume until it became deafening.</p>

<p>“Let us walk home,” Gaunt said quietly, and for a
time they made their way in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, you were splendid,” Drake said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are satisfied,” he answered drily.
“Do you know why my wife left?”</p>

<p>“No. She wouldn’t allow me to accompany her.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that she was angry? Did she say
anything to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but I thought that she was disturbed,”
Drake answered hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Gaunt once more lapsed into silence, and they walked
rapidly along until they reached his home.</p>

<p>“There is a gentleman waiting to see you, sir,” the
footman said deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Braithwaite, sir. I told him that you were
out, but he insisted upon waiting. In fact I couldn’t get
rid of him.”</p>

<p>Gaunt uttered an exclamation of impatience, and went
at once to the library.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked roughly.</p>

<p>“Thank God you’ve come, Gaunt. You must let me
make some money. We haven’t had a meal for two
days and the children are starving,” Braithwaite said
piteously. He was a broken man and tears were in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I told you that I had helped you for the last time,
and when I say——”</p>

<p>Gaunt stopped and an expression of dismay came to
his face when he remembered his vow.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake——” Braithwaite appealed.</p>

<p>“No, for the sake of my word,” Gaunt answered as he
drew a case from his pocket from which he took a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of bank notes. “Take these and I’ll give orders that a
basket shall be got ready for you. It’s too late for shopping
to-night. No thanks, please.”</p>

<p>“May God bless you,” Braithwaite said fervently, and
he was crying quietly.</p>

<p>But Gaunt made no reply.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> soon as his visitor had gone, Gaunt took a
cigar and sat down in an armchair before the
fire. Very carefully he thought over the events
of the night, and it seemed to him that he could not
have acted differently, although at the meeting he had
said more than he had intended. It was his wife that
troubled him, and the effect which his speech would have
upon her. Here he was totally in the dark, and he
began to understand that he knew very little of Lady
Mildred’s real character.</p>

<p>“I had better get it over at once,” he said, and hastened
up-stairs.</p>

<p>He turned the handle of his wife’s bedroom, only to
find that the door was locked.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” he called to her.</p>

<p>“I am tired. Good-night.”</p>

<p>The words were coldly spoken and he went away at
once, but he had no wish for bed and so returned to the
smoking-room where he found Drake awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Braithwaite has spoken to me. You have the
pleasure of knowing that you have made one man supremely
happy,” the latter said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I do not know that that gives me any great pleasure.
At first I refused to help him, and he would have gone
away without a penny, if I hadn’t remembered.”</p>

<p>“You mean—the vow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—and I am beginning to find that it enters into
every detail of my life. It’s a big thing that I’m up against,
and I’m almost tempted to own myself beaten,” Gaunt
said wearily.</p>

<p>“I understand. You are afraid that Lady Mildred——”</p>

<p>“We will not discuss my wife,” Gaunt interrupted him
curtly. “About this meeting—I suppose that the
papers will have a good deal to say in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Your intervention was certainly dramatic. You
spoke splendidly and I believe that your heart was in
what you said. It seems to me that you are a man who
essentially loves a fight, and I sha’n’t be a bit surprised
if you are just as eager to defeat the Belgians as I am.
You wouldn’t have spoken as you did if you had been
animated solely by your vow,” Drake said quietly.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you are right,” Gaunt remarked musingly.
“I always have loved to overcome obstacles and the
greater the odds, the keener I was. I believe there is
some truth in your suggestion. You evidently know me
better than I do myself.”</p>

<p>“I believe that there is more good in you than you
will allow people to see. The apparent hardness has
been a pose that you have produced so long that it has
become almost second nature.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me, Drake. By the bye, I’ve something
amusing to tell you. You remember the deal in Amantis
with Weiss and his crowd. Well, it appears that although
the wire was forged there <em>has</em> been a discovery of gold,
and that the shares have gone up to two pounds. More
than that, they’re well worth the money. Will you
kindly tell me how I stand? First with reference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Weiss, and secondly with reference to the original sellers
of the shares. I don’t mean how I stand from the
strictly business, but from the moral point of view?”
Gaunt asked grimly.</p>

<p>Drake laughed quietly to himself.</p>

<p>“Forgive me. I was only imagining Weiss’s state of
mind. Has he written to you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, but he called when I was out. Do you suggest
that I ought to pay him what his share would have
been?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, and I am speaking from the moral
point of view. The man was engaged in perpetrating a
barefaced swindle——”</p>

<p>“To which I was a party,” Gaunt interrupted him
quietly.</p>

<p>“And I do not think that he ought to benefit. Let
him do his worst. I don’t suppose that he dare make
a fuss,” Drake said without noticing what Gaunt had
said.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will follow your advice, but I quite
anticipate a lively time when Weiss and I do happen to
meet. Are you going to turn in?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am tired, for I found this evening rather
exciting. By the bye, my brother Lindsay arrives to-morrow
from West Africa, and I intended meeting him,
unless you particularly want me.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had a brother on the coast. What
is he doing there?” Gaunt asked with interest.</p>

<p>“He’s a captain in the West African Frontier Force.”</p>

<p>“Why not bring him to stay here? There’s plenty of
room, and he can have as much freedom as if he were at
an hotel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“That’s uncommonly good of you. I should like it
above all things. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are satisfied with my performance
this evening. Good-night,” Gaunt answered grimly.</p>

<p>Drake took the outstretched hand, and the two men
looked at one another steadily, and there was a mutual
liking in their eyes.</p>

<p>Alone, Gaunt began to pace restlessly to and fro.
Even while he had been addressing the meeting his
thoughts were with Lady Mildred, and now a great
fear was clutching at his heart. Had God given him his
wife’s life only to withhold her love for which he longed
with every fibre of his being?</p>

<p>Up-stairs in her room, Lady Mildred was sobbing
piteously. Since the days of her childhood tears had
been an unknown luxury, but now she was stirred to the
very depths.</p>

<p>“I hate him,” she sobbed forth passionately.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning when she went down-stairs
and proceeded at once to the library. John Gaunt rose
when she entered, and uttered a cry of amazement, for her
face was very white and dark shadows encircled her eyes.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, dear? Are you ill?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No—only sick in mind,” she answered wearily.
“Have patience with me, John, for I have a great deal
to say to you, and you may not understand me, for I do
not think that I understand myself.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said quietly, and wheeled an armchair
nearer to the fire. “What has happened?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I will try to explain. I seem to have awakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
from a dream and my whole outlook on life has changed,”
she said, as though she was addressing herself.</p>

<p>“Since when?” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Since last night. As I look at the past I can see
nothing but abject selfishness. As a girl my one thought
was of my own comfort. I always loved the good things
of this life—I suppose I had a conscience somewhere,
but it never troubled me. When you appeared, I was
utterly sick of poverty, and I was glad that you seemed
to care for me. Almost from the first I made up my
mind to be your wife. I didn’t care for you very much,
but still I disliked you rather less than most of the fools
who surrounded me. When you asked me to marry you
my eyes were just a little bit opened, but still I could not
see clearly. We were good friends always, and when
the baby came—then—I think it must have been the
dream that made me see that I was beginning to care for
you. And I was very glad.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s breath came quickly, and his hand stretched
out towards her, but she shook her head when she saw
the mad longing in his eyes.</p>

<p>“But I was not sure. Last night something compelled
me to go with you to that dreadful meeting—perhaps it
was Fate. All my life the idea of physical suffering has
been repugnant to me. To see an animal in pain was
torture. You are surprised at this, John, but you know
very little of me. One of the strictest rules of the training
of women of our class is that to show the slightest
sign of one’s feeling is bad form. We are taught to
batten down our real thoughts, and only let the world see
what it will find agreeable. And therefore we are all
frauds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>She turned her face towards him and to his amazement
there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course I had read of the Congo, and what had
gone on there, but it never made much impression on
my mind—I suppose because I did not really understand.
But as I listened to those who spoke last night,
the whole ghastly tragedy was revealed to me, but still I
did not connect you with the monsters who were responsible
for it.”</p>

<p>She broke off and gave a little sob.</p>

<p>“There was that missionary who told of the baby
whose hands had been chopped off, and for one mad
moment I thought of what I should have suffered if it
had been my own child. Then came the succession of
horrors, of brutality, of torturings, of murder, of the
deliberate mutilations, and still I did not remember. I
could only think of the millions who are in the Congo that
even at the present moment some fresh outrage
might be going on.”</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and her body
trembled slightly. Gaunt stared at her in amazement,
for this was a humor of which he had not thought her
capable. What was she going to say to him? Again
fear held him in its grip.</p>

<p>“And then you rose from your seat. Like a flash it
was revealed to me that you—that my husband was one
of the criminals, who had coined gold by this devilish
torturing of the natives.”</p>

<p>“Mildred, you do not know what you are saying,” he
cried passionately.</p>

<p>“As in a dream I listened to you, and was amazed
that you dared face the people and deliberately own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
to them that you were a murderer,” she said vehemently.</p>

<p>“You are mad,” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“What are you but a murderer? You have benefited
by the slaying of helpless people. You were in the
country and did not raise a hand to prevent it. I listened
to your shameful avowal—and I remembered that you
were my husband,” she said dully.</p>

<p>“I think that you cannot have recovered from your
illness. Had you not better lie down?” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“But that was not the worst. Not only were you my
husband, but you were the father of my child. When
the little one comes to years of understanding he will
hear of the way that his father made his money—he
will bear a name that is tainted,” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face had grown very white, and he faced her
sternly.</p>

<p>“Mildred, is it not rather late in the day to have these
ideas? When I asked you to be my wife, you were
aware of my reputation, and you made no objection,” he
said coldly.</p>

<p>“I was a blind fool. I had no idea what it really
meant, and in those days I do not think I should have
greatly cared even if I had known.”</p>

<p>“What has caused this change?”</p>

<p>“I found out a few hours ago—I found out that I
loved you.”</p>

<p>Her voice scarcely rose above a whisper, and her eyes
were turned away.</p>

<p>“You love me. Thank God!” he cried passionately,
and he stretched out his arms.</p>

<p>“Yes. I love you,” she cried dully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Then nothing else matters.”</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet and he drew nearer to her,
but she raised her hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” she cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Mildred. You tell me that
you love me, and yet——”</p>

<p>“There is blood on your hands. I love you, but instead
of being my glory it is my shame,” she said brokenly.</p>

<p>“You are melodramatic, and that is not usual in you.
I wish you would tell me exactly what you do mean,”
he cried impatiently.</p>

<p>“My meaning is clear. I have tried to explain,
and——”</p>

<p>Gaunt had been controlling himself by a great effort,
but his passion cast off all bonds and he seized her in his
arms. His lips sought hers and he kissed her passionately,
not once but many times, in spite of her struggles
to free herself from his embrace.</p>

<p>“You love me and I tell you that nothing else matters.
I am not worse than other men,” he cried earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then God pity other men,” she answered pantingly.</p>

<p>She had drawn away from him, and there was anger
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“You dare kiss me after what I have said. Do you
think that I am a young girl to be swayed by a caress?”</p>

<p>“You are a fool, and don’t know when you’re well
off,” he said savagely.</p>

<p>And there followed silence, save for the sound of Lady
Mildred’s quick breathing.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, dear. I forgot myself for the moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Let us talk the wretched business over quietly, and I
think that I can convince you that you are making a
great fuss about nothing,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“I am willing to listen to you, but don’t touch me
again, please. If you do I shall hate you.”</p>

<p>He gave her a look that was full of appeal, and when
her face did not soften, a sigh escaped him. But now he
had recovered himself and was determined not to make
another false move. She had told him that she loved
him. With that in his favor he must win in the end, and
could afford to be patient.</p>

<p>“Sit down, dear, and let us talk the thing over sensibly.
You don’t mind if I smoke?”</p>

<p>As he spoke he took a cigar and spent a long time in
preparing it for smoking.</p>

<p>“I was quite a lad when I went to the Congo, and it
is not fair to hold me responsible for what went on in the
country. On my honor, I have never been guilty of the
torturing of a native,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>“But still, the torturing was going on all around you,
and you made no effort to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“My efforts would have been useless. In those days
I had no power,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Then as a decent man, you should have left the
country, and sought a cleaner way of making money.
You admit that you remained there for years. Did you
never feel ashamed?”</p>

<p>“You did not hear all I said last night,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“No. If I had stayed much longer I should have
broken down. I had no wish to make a public exhibition
of myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Now she had recovered herself and spoke in her usual
manner.</p>

<p>“I stated that I would use my money to help the natives,
and I intend to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit that my accusations are just?” she
said quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have always known that my conduct was infamous.
But I intended to make money.”</p>

<p>“Now that you have tardily repented, you think that
you will earn salvation by spending some of your ill-gotten
gold,” she cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure that I have repented,” he answered
grimly.</p>

<p>“Then why did you speak as you did? You must
have known the sensation it would make. The papers
are full of it, and you have earned a very unenviable notoriety.
Did you remember that this notoriety would
reflect upon your wife and child? But answer my question.
If not for repentance, then why did you speak?”
she asked peremptorily.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I will answer that question.”</p>

<p>“Then I must ask Mr. Drake. Of course, I can see
that he has had a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Drake will give you much information,”
he said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say?”</p>

<p>“No. I should like to know how we stand?”</p>

<p>“I have told you and can say no more,” she answered
wearily.</p>

<p>“You have told me that you love me—but in the
next breath you tell me not to touch you. I should like
something definite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Then you must give me time. I said that I loved
you but I am not sure that it is true. When I remember,
I feel that I loathe you.”</p>

<p>“I think I prefer loathing to indifference. Still, your
request is not unreasonable and I am willing to give you
time.</p>

<p>“Thank you—and in the meantime?” she asked
nervously.</p>

<p>“In the meantime it shall be just as you wish. One
question more. If I were to take steps—practical steps
to help the natives, would that count in my favor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But what can you do?” she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Now that I have this additional motive, I may find a
means. Mildred, dear, you have shown me an unsuspected
side of your nature, but I think I am glad.”</p>

<p>“Be patient with me, John. I think I am only just
beginning to find out myself, and it is a painful experience,”
she said with a wistful smile.</p>

<p>She had moved towards the door, and he followed
quickly after her, took her hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>“I shall win. I shall win,” he said with grim determination.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred went straight to the nursery and sat
down by the cot where the child was sleeping. In
speaking to her husband she had been absolutely frank,
and now, when she thought over what she had said, she
was amazed at herself. For a long time she sat there
and wondered what John would do.</p>

<p>The child awoke and she took it in her arms, finding
strange comfort to feel it there.</p>

<p>“Yes, baby mine. You have taught me a great deal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and I am very grateful to you, dear,” she whispered, and
kissed it tenderly.</p>

<p>Lunch was eaten alone, and she remained in her own
rooms all the afternoon. Every now and then she would
find herself wondering what her husband was doing.</p>

<p>When she had ordered tea to be brought to her, the
door opened, and Lady Ethel entered, a look of excitement
on her face.</p>

<p>“What has happened between you and John?” she
cried to Lady Mildred.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Why do you ask the question?”</p>

<p>“I have just passed the library. The door was open.
John and Mr. Drake and another gentleman were
talking. I heard John say in a loud voice: ‘Yes. By
Heaven I will go back to the Congo.’ And then I came
away, for I do not like to listen to what is not intended
for my ears. Is John really going back to that dreadful
country?” Lady Ethel asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred rose to her feet, and her face worked
painfully.</p>

<p>“Should it be true?” she muttered hoarsely.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">John Gaunt</span> was deeply moved by the knowledge
that his wife loved him, and he felt that half
the battle was over; but upon carefully thinking
over what she had said, his confidence vanished, for he
realized that she possessed a will as strong as his own,
and that many a weary day might pass before she would
give herself to him.</p>

<p>At first he was inclined to accuse her of inconsistency
for he had never judged her to be a good woman in the
ordinary sense of the word. But she had spoken with
such feeling that he could not doubt that she was honest
in her loathing of his past.</p>

<p>It is a curious trait in such men as Gaunt that they
can love if they do not respect the object of their
affections, and he had never been blind to his wife’s
faults. Now he found it necessary to regard her from a
different point of view and he was not dissatisfied that
this should be so. So long as there had been no child,
he had been content that she should think of nothing
save her present comfort and enjoyment, but now he was
glad that the mother of his son had shown that she could
rise above such considerations.</p>

<p>Soon there came the memory of her scathing words,
and he began to pace restlessly to and fro. Yes—her
accusations were just, and slowly the scales fell from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
eyes and he saw his actions in their true light. It is not
a pleasant moment in a man’s life when he first understands
that his character is base, but to a few comes this
revelation of self.</p>

<p>Gaunt was not given to analyzing his own character,
but for a long time he sat and thought over the many
discreditable actions of which he had been guilty. True,
there were no mean and petty sins, for if he had
deliberately done wrong it had been with the idea of
reaping a substantial benefit.</p>

<p>It was strange that he should now be thinking of
himself with something akin to contempt, but soon the
mood changed and he concentrated all his brains upon
devising some plan of winning his wife. For the
moment all memory of his vow had vanished, and it was
solely with the idea of pleasing Lady Mildred that he
now sought a scheme to benefit the natives of the
Congo.</p>

<p>He idly took up one of the daily papers that were
spread out on the table and in great staring head-lines
read of the meeting of the previous evening. The
comments were varied, and in many cases not too
favorable to himself, but he passed them by with a grim
smile.</p>

<p>The <cite>Daily Comet</cite> was particularly virulent: “The
finishing touch to an hysterical meeting was put by the
notorious millionaire John Gaunt. With calm effrontery
he admitted that he was a participator in the alleged
outrages and with his tongue in his cheek promised to
give his wealth and apply his brains to the amelioration
of the lot of the natives of the Congo. Apparently his
offer was received with acclamation, and it is strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
indeed that a meeting, which consisted chiefly of divines
of various creeds, should welcome into its fold a man
with Gaunt’s record. If rumor speaks truly, the Congo
is not the worst part of the millionaire’s past. With due
respect for the law of libel, we suggest that his hands are
not too clean with respect to some of his numerous
company promotions. We have heard a story with
reference to a deal in Amanti shares, to which we may
have occasion to refer more particularly at a future date.
In the meantime we intend to follow closely John
Gaunt’s footsteps in the path of unctuous righteousness.”</p>

<p>The paper fluttered to the ground and Gaunt did not
move for a few moments, but there was a curious smile
on his face. Ahead he could see a fight, and he was
ready for the fray.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and he turned round
to see Drake enter followed by a tall man whose tanned
skin spoke of long residence in a tropical climate.</p>

<p>“This is my brother Lindsay,” Drake said by way of
introduction.</p>

<p>“I am grateful for your invitation, sir,” Lindsay
Drake said, “and gladly accept it. It will enable me to
see so much more of my brother.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will make yourself at home,” Gaunt
answered, and then took up the <cite>Daily Comet</cite> which he
handed to Edward Drake. “Have you read this?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p>Gaunt went to a cabinet and brought out a box of
cigars, which he handed to the soldier.</p>

<p>“So you have just come back from the coast. You
are looking remarkably fit,” he remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I got back this morning. My brother has
been telling me that you were in the Congo Free State
for some time. A pretty wretched country, I should
think, but then, no part of West Africa is very
comfortable,” Captain Drake answered, with a frank
smile.</p>

<p>The brothers were remarkably alike and were both
eminently clean-looking men whom one would trust and
like instinctively.</p>

<p>“A dastardly article,” Edward Drake cried indignantly,
and threw down the paper. “What is the
meaning of it? The <cite>Comet</cite> is generally fair, in spite of
its Yankee methods.”</p>

<p>“It is easily explained, but I shall probably shock
you, for we English people pride ourselves upon the
honesty of our press. And we are not far wrong,
although they have played the game of the Belgians for
years past. When King Leopold was alive he spent a
portion of his revenue from the Congo in subsidizing the
press. In the United States he was more successful
than in this country, for here it is impossible to buy the
policy of a newspaper. That is in cash—a peerage is
not considered a bribe. So the King went to work in
his usual diplomatic way. Although the papers are incorruptible,
their correspondents are more pliable. Look
back and you will remember how few cables have come
from Belgium relating to the Congo, and the reason is
not far to seek. Many men have come from the Congo
with a sheaf of horrors with which they were about to
startle Europe—but the horrors have never been made
public. The King had a persuasive tongue, he was free
with his money, and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilà tout</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“It seems incredible,” Drake cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“But it is none the less true. Read Mark Twain’s
famous ‘Soliloquy of King Leopold.’ Never has such
an indictment been penned, and the ways of the Belgian
press bureau are proved up to the hilt. Now that the
King is dead those upon whom his mantle has fallen are
pursuing the same course. Not many hours will pass
before they will turn their attention to me. Every
possible means will be tried to silence me, by bribes, and
threats. I hope this doesn’t bore you?” Gaunt said
suddenly turning to Captain Drake.</p>

<p>“On the contrary I am deeply interested. I have
had some experience of the Belgian swine myself.
Their methods are even worse than the Germans in
Southwest Africa, and <em>their</em> methods are pretty ghastly,”
the latter said quietly.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you would mind taking my brother into
your confidence. I mean, with reference to our plans
for the future,” Edward Drake added hastily, when he
saw a frown appear on Gaunt’s face.</p>

<p>“Not at all. His knowledge of West Africa may be
useful,” Gaunt answered readily.</p>

<p>For the moment he had imagined that Drake meant
to tell the captain of his vow and he had a great
objection to any one having knowledge of it.</p>

<p>“I read your speech when I was coming up from
Plymouth, and I may say that I admire you for
your pluck,” Captain Drake said with quiet enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Gaunt flushed at the praise for he felt that he was little
deserving of it.</p>

<p>“I am prepared to enter heart and soul into your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
plans,” the captain continued; “I have lived among the
natives and have always found them decent. I am not
one who considers the nigger but little better than the
brute. True, their intelligence is not very great, but
they can be capable of great loyalty and have a keen
sense of gratitude. There isn’t a better fighting man
in the world than the properly trained Haussa. Will
you not tell me something of your intentions?”</p>

<p>Gaunt rose from his chair and an expression of great
gravity came into his face.</p>

<p>“Since last night, many schemes have come into my
mind, but so far none of them have been quite feasible.
I think it is a hopeless task to try to change the present
conditions in the Congo by peaceful methods, although
it is my intention to see the foreign secretary at an
early date. Should he fail me, as I fully anticipate, I
have wondered if it would not be possible for us to try
force?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Edward Drake cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“I presume that you would consider us morally
justified if, in endeavoring to turn the Belgians out
of the Congo, bloodshed should ensue?” Gaunt asked
quietly.</p>

<p>“Please explain yourself,” Edward Drake cried in
wonder.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is rather a mad idea, but it may be
practicable. You are probably aware that the Belgians
have no navy. That being so a single cruiser would
give us command of the sea, so far as they are concerned.
There are many war-ships nearing completion
in the British dockyards for foreign countries—principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
for the South American Republics. For a
financial consideration one of these republics might be
willing to lease me a cruiser for a few months. If we
could safely get her away and proceeded to the mouth
of the Congo, we should be masters of the situation. No
rubber could leave the Free State, and all trade would
be at a standstill. Of course, we couldn’t expect to
conquer the country by force, for we shouldn’t have
sufficient men, but I think England would be pretty
certain to intervene if we gave her the lead.”</p>

<p>Edward Drake stared at Gaunt in utter amazement,
for he was astounded at the audacity of the
scheme.</p>

<p>“Yes. By Heaven! I will go back to the Congo
myself,” Gaunt said with grim determination. “Now,
Drake, you’re my conscience and what have you to say
about the morality of the idea? You must remember
that the mouth of the Congo is fortified and fighting
might ensue.”</p>

<p>Edward Drake’s face was ablaze with excitement and
his likeness to his brother was accentuated.</p>

<p>“I think that any means would be justified to put an
end to this abominable traffic in human lives,” he said
with great earnestness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I’m with you heart and soul,” the captain
said gravely, but his eyes were sparkling with excitement.</p>

<p>“It is a big thing and will require careful consideration.
Let us take a day or two to think it over, and
then we can have a long talk. Captain Drake, I am
glad that you are with us for I think that you can be of
great assistance. Drake, will you introduce your brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to my wife and Lady Ethel? You will find them up-stairs.
I am going into the City.”</p>

<p>The brothers stood and watched him leave the room.</p>

<p>“That’s a man,” Captain Drake said with quiet enthusiasm.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the Palm Garden of the Carlton Hotel sat a party
of four, two of whom were in the highest spirits,
while the faces of the remaining pair were extremely
grave.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred was next to Edward Drake and they
exchanged but few remarks while Captain Drake and
Lady Ethel were amusing themselves by exchanging
critical comments upon the fashionable crowd who were
drinking tea.</p>

<p>“You are very silent,” Edward Drake said to John
Gaunt’s wife, and she turned her eyes full upon him.</p>

<p>“Is it true that my husband is addressing another
meeting to-night about the Congo?” she asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I believe that he contemplates further engagements,”
Drake answered.</p>

<p>“It is evident that you are responsible for this curious
change in Mr. Gaunt’s mode of life. I wonder if you
have considered me at all. You must know that since
the big meeting at which I was present my position has
not altogether been a pleasant one. Every friend and
acquaintance I have met has not hesitated to show their
curiosity. Cannot you give me some explanation why
all this wretched publicity should be necessary?” she
asked quietly.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred had agreed to accompany her sister
solely for the purpose of having a quiet talk with Drake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
but as yet she had not dared to ask the question, the answer
to which she dreaded to hear. Ever since the previous
afternoon when her sister had told her what she
had overheard in the library, her mind had been
strangely perturbed. Her first impulse had been to run
to her husband and ask if it were true that he was going
to the Congo, but an unwonted feeling of shyness stayed
her.</p>

<p>“Surely you cannot object to Mr. Gaunt’s wish to
help the natives? His purpose is a noble one and
worthy of the admiration of all good women,” he answered
simply.</p>

<p>“I have never pretended to be a good woman, Mr.
Drake. But you have not answered my question.
Why is all this publicity necessary?” she persisted.</p>

<p>Drake did not reply, and she smiled faintly when she
saw that all his attention was fixed on Lady Ethel and
his brother. For an instant he was off his guard, and
she read the secret which he had not dared yet to admit
to himself.</p>

<p>Edward Drake loved the young girl to whose face animation
gave an additional beauty. And he was thinking
that she had never showed to him the evident liking she
felt for his brother. As he watched them talking eagerly
it seemed to him that they might have been friends
for years and he uttered a faint sigh.</p>

<p>“I asked you a question,” Lady Mildred said pointedly.</p>

<p>“I really beg your pardon. I fear that my thoughts
were wandering,” he cried hastily.</p>

<p>“Does my husband intend to return to the Congo?”
she asked and her voice scarcely rose above a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Drake was astonished and for a few moments did not
reply. It had been easy to guess that the relations between
Gaunt and his wife were strained, and he did not
know how far the millionaire intended to give Lady Mildred
his confidence.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that you should ask your husband?”
he suggested quietly.</p>

<p>The reproach was delicately veiled, yet it was none
the less present, and she was quick to feel it. In an instant
her pride was in arms and when she spoke her
voice was very cold.</p>

<p>“I will do so. By the bye, wouldn’t it be only kind
to give your brother a hint? Captain Drake’s admiration
is so very open—and Lady Ethel is so very young,” she
added quickly.</p>

<p>If her intention was to wound, she succeeded only too
well, for Drake’s face was grimly set. It was revealed to
him with overwhelming force that he had given himself
unreservedly to the beautiful girl who faced him. At
the moment, a reply was impossible, and he struggled
fiercely to give no sign of emotion, for he was conscious
that Lady Mildred’s eyes were fixed keenly upon him;
but she relented very quickly.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Mr. Drake. I should not have said
that. I really do not know what is the matter with me
this afternoon,” she said nervously.</p>

<p>Still Drake did not speak, and he turned away his face
from her eyes. It must be remembered that his life had
been untouched by the influence of any woman save his
mother, and when love comes to such a one, it is apt to
sweep everything before it. And he understood that
marriage with Lady Ethel was an impossibility. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
should she care for him—and his blood tingled at the
mere idea—how could he offer himself to one who was
accustomed to every luxury? His total income would
be insufficient to provide her with the clothes that she
wore so gracefully.</p>

<p>Yes, Lady Mildred was right, for it was impossible to
mistake the look that was in his brother’s eyes—a look
of simple adoration. Those who spend the greater part
of their lives in savage countries, away from their kind,
lose all sense of the conventionalities which bind those
who stay at home. For twelve months Lindsay Drake
had been surrounded by black faces and the mere sight
of Lady Ethel’s fair beauty had sent him headlong to
her feet. It was not his nature to conceal his feelings,
and she knew that he was her slave, and that she could
do with him as she willed. Every woman must take a
delight in the knowledge that she is loved, and Lady
Ethel was no exception, for she never imagined that
there could be any harm in accepting his worship. But
suddenly she chanced to look at Edward Drake, and all
the color ebbed from her face, and she stopped in the
middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>There ensued one of those strange silences, in which
there is a touch of constraint, and the arrival of a lady
and gentleman at the next table was a welcome interruption.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was at the meeting, and Gaunt’s speech was
the most dramatic thing that I ever heard in my life,”
the man was saying.</p>

<p>“What do you think he did it for—advertisement?”
his companion asked.</p>

<p>“No. He is not that kind of man. I’ve met him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
once or twice and have found him a most attractive personality.
In fact I am making him the model of one of
the characters in my next book. Of course the man’s
been a bit of a blackguard.”</p>

<p>Edward Drake half rose from his chair but Lady
Mildred placed her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please. It is well to hear one’s neighbor’s
opinions,” she said, and he realized that she would not go.</p>

<p>“But he is an interesting kind of blackguard. If he
had lived a few hundred years ago, he would have been
quite a moral character. Just imagine what colossal
impudence a man must possess to do as he did. Remember
that he was as bad as any of the Belgians in the
Congo. He coins a fortune out of the ill-treatment of
the natives, and when his pockets are full he stands up
and complacently denounces those who are doing as he
has done.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that he spoke if not for advertisement?”
the lady asked curiously.</p>

<p>“I am puzzled to find a reason. He spoke with such
evident sincerity that one might almost imagine that he
had been suddenly—what the Salvationists term—‘saved.’
Of course you know that he married that good-looking
woman, Lady Mildred Blythe, and I am wondering
what she thinks of it all. Her ladyship is not the
sort of person to——”</p>

<p>“Now I am ready,” Lady Mildred said very quietly,
and they made their way from the corner.</p>

<p>Edward Drake gave a quick look at the speaker from
whom they had been hidden by a group of palms, and
recognized a famous novelist who was quick to see his
indiscretion, for he ceased to speak, and his face became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
deeply flushed. It chanced that he was acquainted by
sight with Lady Mildred and he half rose, as though it
was his intention to follow and apologize, but quickly
subsided into his seat again.</p>

<p>A motor-car was in waiting, and the order was given
to return to Park Lane, but to all of them the drive was
unpleasant. Lady Mildred stared fixedly through the
window and remained silent until they reached home.</p>

<p>“I am going to talk to my husband, but afterwards I
should like you to come to my room,” she said to
Edward Drake and he bowed in reply.</p>

<p>John Gaunt was in the library and he looked up
quickly when his wife entered but his face remained
grave as he stood waiting for her to speak. It was the
first time they had met since their interview of the
previous afternoon, and he wondered what had caused
her to come.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” he said politely.</p>

<p>In the intervening hours he had been carefully considering
his attitude towards his wife and had determined
to make no advance until she showed him plainly that it
would be welcome to her.</p>

<p>“I can only stay a minute. We’ve just come from the
Carlton. They say that listeners never hear any good of
themselves. I’ve listened to a very candid opinion about
you, and I’m a little upset. John, is it quite necessary
that you should go on with this Congo business?
Couldn’t you give up this meeting to-night and take me
out to dinner?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p>He looked at her eagerly, but her face was quickly
turned away, and he sighed a sigh of utter weariness.</p>

<p>“It is impossible. I must keep my promise. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
sorry that you have heard anything unpleasant and hope
the memory of it will quickly vanish. I have made up
my mind to do all that is in my power to help the natives
of the Congo, and I am not likely to turn back. I must
warn you that the fight is likely to be a severe one, and
it is very probable that I shall suffer, for my opponents
are not too particular in their methods. If you are to
suffer with me, I am deeply sorry, but it cannot be
helped,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“I wish that I could understand you,” she said timidly.</p>

<p>“I wish that I could understand myself,” he answered
with a smile.</p>

<p>He moved towards the door, but she showed no sign
of going.</p>

<p>“Is it true that you are going back to that wretched
country?” she asked desperately.</p>

<p>John Gaunt was surprised at the question, and did not
answer at once.</p>

<p>“If it is necessary, I shall go. But why do you ask?
Has Drake said anything to you?” he exclaimed suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Doesn’t it strike you that all this is
rather hard upon me? Surely a wife is entitled to her
husband’s confidence. Ever since baby was born you
seem to have changed completely. Why does Mr.
Drake live with us? What has he to do with this
change?”</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to answer the question without
revealing everything, and he was quite determined
that his wife should not know of the vow that he had
made. What could he say to her?</p>

<p>“I believe that he is a good man, but surely it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
necessary to have him constantly with you?” she continued
nervously.</p>

<p>“I like Drake, and I am greatly indebted to him.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you give orders to prepare the yacht and let
us go away—just you and I—for a long voyage? I
think I could be very happy with you—alone,”
she said in a low voice, but her eyes were full of appeal.</p>

<p>“I should like nothing better in the world but I can’t
do it,” he answered firmly, but he was struggling fiercely
with himself to subdue the mad desire to take her in his
arms and cover her face with kisses.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she answered coldly, and left him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Gaunt’s</span> first impulse was to hasten after his
wife and accept the proposal she had made.
There could be no doubt that she had offered
him all that he was struggling to obtain—her love; and
if he had agreed to go away on the yacht, they might
live the life of which he had dreamed. To do him justice
the temptation, though strong, was but momentary, for
he quickly remembered that to leave England at the
present moment would be to break the vow that he had
made.</p>

<p>“No. I will win her and yet be honest to myself,” he
said grimly.</p>

<p>The fever of fighting had entered into his blood, and
he was longing to come to close quarters with the enemy.
In fact he was looking forward to the meeting at which
he was to be the chief speaker, and was determined that
he would not mince matters, but would state the truth,
brutally and forcibly.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred’s complaint was a just one, for blows
would be dealt unscrupulously and there was plenty of
ammunition for the enemy in his past. It was quite
clear to Gaunt that the Congo officials in Brussels would
show no mercy, and would use any weapon that came to
hand; perhaps it was this knowledge that made him
eager for the fray.</p>

<p>The love of a fight was born in the man, and his eyes
sparkled as he thought of the coming contest. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
moment the vow was forgotten and ceased to be the
motive that guided him.</p>

<p>Gaunt and Edward Drake dined alone, and the latter
spoke but little during the meal.</p>

<p>“Did Lady Mildred tell you of an unfortunate occurrence
this afternoon?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“She mentioned that she had overheard some one make
remarks about myself that were the reverse of complimentary.
Tell me the details,” Gaunt said with a smile,
and he listened quietly to Drake’s accurate description
of what had happened.</p>

<p>“There is a certain amount of truth in what the man
said, but I can imagine that my wife was annoyed. I
fear that she will have to get used to listening to much
worse things than that,” Gaunt answered drily.</p>

<p>“It is a pity. Don’t you think she might go abroad
for a while with Lady Ethel?” Drake suggested nervously.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t go and I think that she would prefer to
be in England.”</p>

<p>“By the bye, she asked me the reason of the recent
change in you, and——”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” Gaunt interrupted him
quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing. And when she wanted to know if you
were going to the Congo, I referred her to you. Don’t
you think it would be as well to give Lady Mildred your
entire confidence? I can see that things are not quite
right between you.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Drake. If we are to remain friends,
that is a subject that must never be mentioned between
us. I may not be able to manage my own conscience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
but, by Heaven, I’ll manage my own domestic affairs,”
Gaunt cried warmly.</p>

<p>“Forgive me. It was not from any desire to meddle
that I spoke. Gaunt, I like you and I like Lady Mildred.
When two people are proud, misunderstandings
arise easily, and I thought that I might be able to help
you both,” Drake said gently.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I shouldn’t have spoken quite so
roughly, but I think you understand. We’ve just time
for a smoke before we start. Come into the library,”
Gaunt said and placed his hand on Drake’s shoulder with
an affectionate touch.</p>

<p>Their characters were utterly different, and yet their
mutual liking was increasing daily as their knowledge of
one another grew.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking over that ‘cruiser’ idea,” Gaunt
began when they had lighted their cigars, “and I’m not
at all sure that the scheme is not practicable as a last
resource. I intend to make inquiries at once, but the
difficulty is to do so without attracting attention.
Secrecy is essential to success.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that there is a greater chance of
making the British government move now that you have
started to work. The fact that you are fighting for the
natives gives that touch of romance which is necessary
to rouse the public’s interest.”</p>

<p>“There is not much romance about John Gaunt. Come
along or we shall be late.”</p>

<p>The meeting had been well advertised, and Drake was
right in his surmise that Gaunt’s personality would
attract when the wrongs of the natives failed to do so,
for the large hall was packed from floor to ceiling. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
chairman wasted but little time in his opening remarks
and quickly called upon Gaunt to speak.</p>

<p>When he rose to his feet and faced them, there was
the same look of defiance on his face that had been there
at the previous meeting. In simple language he began
to tell them of his experiences on the Congo and there
was no straining after effect, but soon he began to see
that their attention was engrossed by his words, and he
spoke with more feeling.</p>

<p>There are many men in the world who are born
orators and yet do not know it, and such a man was
Gaunt. Until a few days ago he had never addressed a
public meeting in his life, save those of his companies,
so he had had no opportunity of discovering the powers
that lay dormant in him. There is no more exhilarating
feeling than that of the speaker who holds a vast multitude
in the hollow of his hand, and who can sway them
as he pleases, to laughter, or to tears.</p>

<p>And a great hush fell upon the building as with
graphic touch he painted the terrible torturings of a
nation. And once more Gaunt realized the baseness of
the past that he had played in the Congo, so that when
he said the last few solemn words he knew himself to be
what he really was.</p>

<p>There was no applause, only a painful hush when he
resumed his seat; but still his lips moved, and only
Drake who was beside him could catch the muttered
words.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, I’ll undo the past.”</p>

<p>Then he chanced to look among the crowd and saw
an elderly gentleman of aristocratic appearance seated a
few rows from the front, whose overcoat was slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
open, and across his white shirt was the broad ribbon of
an order.</p>

<p>“So the Baron has arrived,” Gaunt remarked under
his breath, and a tense look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as the meeting was over, they returned to
Park Lane and Drake retired to his room, for he was
very tired. Gaunt put on a smoking-jacket and settled
down comfortably before the fire, but there was an air of
expectation on his face and it was not very long before a
footman entered and approached his master.</p>

<p>“Baron de Croiseuil wishes to see you, sir,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“Show him in here,” Gaunt replied and then rose to
his feet and stood facing the door to await his visitor.</p>

<p>In a short time the footman returned and was immediately
followed by the gentleman whom Gaunt had
noticed at the meeting.</p>

<p>“This is an unexpected pleasure, Baron,” Gaunt
remarked quietly.</p>

<p>“Not quite unexpected, I think. May I sit down, for
I think that our interview is likely to be a long one?”</p>

<p>The Baron spoke English with only a faint trace of an
accent, but his manner and appearance were distinctly
foreign. Without waiting for Gaunt to answer, he
moved an armchair into position into which he sank
gracefully.</p>

<p>“May I smoke?” he said as he produced a gold
cigarette case. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien, mon ami</i>, I listened to your
speech with much interest, and pray allow me to
congratulate you upon your eloquence, but the subject
matter was deplorable,” the Baron said quietly.</p>

<p>“I do not think that your visit is likely to do any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
good. Of course I know why you have come to
England,” Gaunt answered coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is easy to guess. The cabled reports of your
speech the other night seemed incredible and so I
thought it better to run over to find out the truth myself.
<em>Helas!</em> It is even worse than we had imagined. May
I ask if you have taken leave of your senses?” the
Baron asked suavely.</p>

<p>“Have I the appearance of a madman?” Gaunt
answered with a harsh laugh. “Baron, you and I know
one another pretty well, and it is better that we should
be quite frank. I suppose that I am the only man in
England that really understands the little game that you
people are playing in the Congo. In my public utterances
I have definitely stated that I intend to concentrate
all my energies upon defeating you. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blague</i>, just something to say for a
little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</i> for yourself. As you say, we know one
another, and I am quite sure that you are not the man to
go against your own interests, especially those of a
pecuniary nature,” the Baron said smoothly.</p>

<p>“If you think that, then I am afraid that you do not
know me. I am perfectly serious, and I shall not rest
until your régime in the Congo comes to an end.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” the Baron ejaculated, and lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on Gaunt’s face and he studied
him keenly. For some time neither of them spoke, and
at last the Baron threw away his half consumed cigarette
with an impatient movement.</p>

<p>“It is a thousand pities, for I like you, Gaunt. I
knew you as a young man and was one of the first to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
recognize your ability. It is a thousand pities,” he
repeated reflectively.</p>

<p>Still Gaunt did not speak, and now their eyes met, the
Baron’s cold and menacing.</p>

<p>“You are young and very rash,” he continued quietly,
“but with your inside knowledge you ought to recognize
our power. Already you have done us serious injury,
but I am willing to forgive that if you will promise to
remain silent in the future. In a few years our task will
be accomplished, and——”</p>

<p>“In a few years—when you have drained the Congo
dry—when you have killed off the people in thousands,
and when the whole country is desolate. Baron, I
understand your policy, for, as you say, I have inside
knowledge. I repeat that the infamies shall cease,”
Gaunt said with grim determination.</p>

<p>“May I ask if this is blackmail?”</p>

<p>Gaunt jumped to his feet and stood over the Baron
with upraised fist.</p>

<p>“Ah! I forgot that you were a rich man. But if
that is not your motive, may I ask why you have turned
upon those who were once your friends?” the Baron
asked calmly, and he did not appear to notice Gaunt’s
attitude.</p>

<p>“I think you had better go,” Gaunt said in a low
voice that was tense with suppressed anger.</p>

<p>“Not until we come to an understanding, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>;
I am going to stay here until I convince you that you
must be silent—for your own safety.”</p>

<p>Now the suavity had left the Baron’s voice and he
spoke sharply as he took a collection of documents from
his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“This is your <em>dossier</em>, which contains a record of all
your actions while you were on the Congo. We often
find such things useful in dealing with people who take
up the same attitude as yourself. Permit me to remind
you of a few incidents. You may find the memory
painful, but you bring it on yourself. I wonder if you
remember the case of the man Marillier. He was shot—wasn’t
he, and by——? Ah! You have turned a
little pale. We have a long memory—we who govern
the Congo. Murder is a crime that may be punished
after many years. Let me remind you of the whole
history. You will forgive me if I speak at some
length.”</p>

<p>The Baron had risen, and the two men faced one
another.</p>

<p>“Or shall I remain silent? It only requires your
promise,” the Baron continued very quietly and there
was a smile on his face.</p>

<p>“I defy you!” Gaunt cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>And the Baron no longer smiled.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> would have been impossible to choose a more
suitable emissary than the Baron de Croiseuil for
the task of dealing with John Gaunt, for he was an
astute diplomatist, and entirely devoid of scruples. During
the last few years there had grown up in Belgium a
group of men whose prosperity was solely due to the
Congo. Many of them had spent varying periods of
time in that country, and had returned without the sense
of honor which they may once have possessed.</p>

<p>When Gaunt first went to West Africa, the Baron was
a high official of the Free State, and he was mainly responsible
for the carrying out of the late King’s decree
that rubber must be got, and that the method of obtaining
it need not be considered. It was a congenial task,
for as he made money for his master, so did he line his
own pockets, and the time came when he could return to
Belgium a man of wealth, and covered with the honors
that the King delighted to confer upon those who had
succeeded in sending to him the millions which he
needed for the pursuit of his life of vice.</p>

<p>But when Baron de Croiseuil arrived home he was not
allowed to remain idle for long, and his services were
utilized to stifle the cry for reform that was just beginning
to be heard in England, and the United States, and
right well did he carry out the duties.</p>

<p>The death of the King had come at an opportune moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
for it would give the Belgian rule of the Congo a
fresh lease of life, and there would be no necessity to
change their methods, for it would be a simple matter to
answer criticisms by saying that, now there was a new
king, conditions would be improved, provided that time
was allowed to bring about the necessary reforms. And
all the time there was no intention to relax the rigor of
their rule, but rather to force the natives to work the
harder, so that the harvest might be garnered, before
Europe awoke to the fact that it had been cleverly hoodwinked.</p>

<p>All was peace and contentment in Brussels, for each
ship brought its increasing cargo of rubber and the demand
for reform had almost ceased; until the big meeting
took place in which Gaunt had made so dramatic an
appearance.</p>

<p>The Baron immediately realized the seriousness of the
situation, for naturally the words of a man, who had been
one of the first to exploit the Congo, would carry great
weight. A hurried meeting took place in Brussels, and
as a consequence De Croiseuil came to England with an
entirely free hand, and practically an unlimited purse.</p>

<p>It was with great interest that he had attended the
meeting, and his amazement was great when he listened
to Gaunt’s speech.</p>

<p>“He speaks like an honest man,” had been his
thought.</p>

<p>And so he had entered the library without any confidence
that he could succeed in influencing John Gaunt,
but he was determined to leave no stone unturned.</p>

<p>“You can do your worst. I defy you,” Gaunt repeated
harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>There was an evil light in the Baron’s eyes, but he
spoke calmly and slowly, pronouncing each word with
great distinctness.</p>

<p>“I think that you will change your decision, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>.
If not for your own sake, for your wife’s. May I suggest
that you do not enjoy the best of reputations in
your own country. You have made many enemies, who
will be only too glad to seize any opportunity of doing
you an injury, and there are many vulnerable places in
your armor. It may be necessary that I should join
hands with your enemies, and one in particular. By a
happy chance I know Mr. Julian Weiss; we have had
business deals together, and he is a man who never forgets
an injury. Forgive me, Gaunt. This conversation
is extremely unpleasant to me personally, and I would
gladly drop it if you would only say one little word.”</p>

<p>“I have given you my answer,” Gaunt said gravely.</p>

<p>“Still, I do not despair of making you change your
mind. This little <em>dossier</em> contains other details of your
life in the Congo. Of course it is a savage country, and
one doesn’t expect our domestic fireside morals to prevail,
but——”</p>

<p>He stopped and shrugged his shoulders expressively,
while his face bore a deprecating smile.</p>

<p>“Lady Mildred is a charming woman, and I am proud
to number her among my acquaintances. I propose to
cultivate my acquaintanceship with her. It would be
deplorable if I am compelled to let her know something
of the kind of life you led in the Free State.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face had grown very white, and he required
all his strength of will to keep back a flow of contemptuous
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“My patience is exhausted, and I think——”</p>

<p>He ceased speaking and turned round quickly, for the
door had opened.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disturb you. I thought you were
alone,” Edward Drake, for it was he who entered, said
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Don’t go away, Drake, for I should like to introduce
you to the Baron de Croiseuil, whose name you probably
know,” John said quietly.</p>

<p>The Baron bowed, and Drake returned the salutation,
but his manner was frigid, for he was only too well acquainted
with the part that this smiling Belgian had
played in the Congo.</p>

<p>“The Baron has come to England to try and silence
me and he has told me pretty plainly what the consequences
will be if I refuse to be silenced,” John Gaunt
said grimly.</p>

<p>“I think it would be wiser that our business should
not be discussed before a third party. This gentleman
has the air of a priest, and I will leave him to give you
good advice. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir, messieurs.</i>”</p>

<p>He bowed very politely, and walked to the door.</p>

<p>“I will give you till the morning for consideration. I
am staying at the Ritz, and you will find me there till
midday.”</p>

<p>The Baron smiled pleasantly, and it was not until he
had entered the motor-car that was awaiting him, that
he permitted the mask to fall from his face. It was now
evident that all his resources would be needed to compel
Gaunt to hold his tongue, and he was not at all sure that
he would ultimately succeed. But he was an astute
judge of human nature, and rather imagined that Gaunt’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
one weak spot lay on his wife, and so he determined to
turn his attention to Lady Mildred.</p>

<p>In the hall of the Ritz Hotel he found a gentleman
waiting him, who rose to greet him.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Sherren. I am sorry to be late, but
it was unavoidable. Will you come up to my sitting-room?”
the Baron said politely.</p>

<p>Charles Sherren was an insignificant little man who
would have been quite unnoticeable had it not been for
his eyes, which were remarkably intelligent. Well
known in Fleet Street, but unattached to any newspaper,
he was reported to make a good income, for he had
been successful in one or two brilliant journalistic coups,
that had brought him into prominence. An accomplished
linguist, no one knew his real nationality,
although many called him a Jew, a statement which he
vigorously resented, in spite of his rather Semitic type of
features.</p>

<p>To the Baron he had always proved a reliable tool,
and had carried out the delicate instructions he was
wont to receive with great skill. Sherren was responsible
for the many reassuring statements that had
appeared in the papers concerning the state of affairs in
the Congo, and it was owing to his adroitness that
editors had never suspected that their papers were being
used by the Congo Press Bureau. In fact his name had
never been publicly connected with the Free State, and
on that account his services were likely to prove of all
the greater value.</p>

<p>“I have just come from Gaunt,” the Baron remarked,
when they were seated in his room.</p>

<p>“Were you successful?” Sherren asked eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Quite the reverse, and now I shall require you to
carry out my little programme. As a matter of fact I
have given him till twelve o’clock to-morrow to climb
down, but I have little hope that he will do so. I want
you to understand that this man must be crushed at once,
for he is doing us incalculable harm. It requires but an
entente between England and Germany to cause the
Powers to intervene. In spite of all our efforts, reports
continue to come from the Congo, and if this campaign
is continued, the British people may take it into their
stupid heads to run riot as they did in the case of the
Armenian atrocities. It needs but another Gladstone to
rouse them, and this man Gaunt is a born orator. In
fact I must admit that I myself was rather moved by
what he said to-night,” the Baron wound up cynically.</p>

<p>“I cannot rush the matter. It is a difficult business
to use the newspapers for private interests, and the
greatest tact is necessary. Fortunately for us, Gaunt’s
financial reputation is none of the best, and I know one
or two people who are anxious to get at him,” Sherren
said reflectively.</p>

<p>“Particularly Julian Weiss,” the Baron said significantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, over their Amanti deal. But unfortunately
Weiss is equally involved with Gaunt. In fact I think
that he was the prime mover in the swindle. The man
who forged the cable is on his way back to England,
and arrives in a day or two. I will see him, and it may
be possible to bring the matter up.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity to do that. It will be sufficient
to place me in a position to threaten Gaunt. I only
want the evidence,” De Croiseuil said quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“I will do my best to get it, but it may prove costly.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carte blanche</i>,” the Baron replied laconically.</p>

<p>“That will certainly make things easier. But I fear
that you have a difficult task before you, for Gaunt is
the very devil. I know, for I tried a little bout with
him once upon a time and I came off second best,”
Sherren remarked with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a strong man, but so am I.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what you intend to do if threats are of no
avail?”</p>

<p>“Carry out the threats and blacken his character in
every way, for that will naturally discount the value of
what he says. The public are not yet convinced that
the man is honest in what he is doing.” The Baron
paused for a moment, and then continued reflectively,
“I wonder if it would be possible to accuse him of
blackmail. It might be believed that he was taking this
line to force money out of us.”</p>

<p>“But Gaunt is a millionaire, and such a charge would
rebound upon yourself.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, and it is a card that I must
keep in reserve for it is a risky one to play. By the bye,
have you any idea of the relations which exist between
Gaunt and his wife? What does gossip say?” the
Baron asked casually.</p>

<p>“That she married him for his money. As to Gaunt,
I have heard that he acted like a madman when it was
thought that his wife would die. I can’t tell you more
than that.”</p>

<p>“Lady Mildred gave me the impression of being a
very proud woman. I wonder if she has much influence
with her husband?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“It is hard to say,” Sherren said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“But I should imagine that she would loathe the idea
of any scandal. And he is in love with her, you say?
Well, I cannot decry his taste, for she is very beautiful,
but cold—cold. Ah, these English women, I can’t
understand them. To be loved by them is bliss, but to
love—that is another matter.”</p>

<p>And the Baron was supposed to have a very complete
knowledge of the feminine sex, if rumor spoke truly.
He sighed wearily as he lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>“Start work on the lines I have suggested, and come
to see me to-morrow night. Until then you are to do
nothing definite. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Sherren held out his hand which the Baron took for
just a moment, and then left.</p>

<p>“The man is a little reptile but he is useful,” De Croiseuil
remarked, and then he took a handkerchief from
his pocket with which he carefully wiped the hand that
had touched Sherren.</p>

<p>“I wonder what is Gaunt’s motive?” he said aloud,
and when he fell asleep, he had found no answer to the
question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lunch</span> had been served in Lady Mildred’s own
sitting-room, for she was reluctant to meet her
husband until she saw her way more clearly.
It was an unusual state of mind, this indecision and rapid
change of feeling, for at one moment she felt that the
only thing that mattered was the love of her husband,
and then she would remember that terrible evening of
the Congo meeting, when he had spoken words that had
caused her to turn from him with loathing.</p>

<p>From the day of their engagement she had realized
that there were hidden depths in his character, and often
she was conscious of a fear of him that disturbed her
strangely. That morning she had read in the paper an
account of the speech which he had made on the previous
evening, and it was evident that he was in deadly
earnest in his intention to continue the crusade. And
had she not encouraged him? Yes, and almost immediately
afterwards implored him to give it up and take
her away in the yacht. His motive perplexed her; it
was difficult to imagine that his whole character could
have been revolutionized so suddenly.</p>

<p>“I believe it is through the influence of Mr. Drake,
and I hate him for it,” she said vindictively.</p>

<p>Her reverie was disturbed by the entrance of her sister.</p>

<p>“John wants to know if you are unwell,” Lady Ethel
stated and sat down although she saw that her presence
was unwelcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“I am not ill, but I wished to be alone,” Lady Mildred
answered coldly.</p>

<p>She was conscious that her sister was regarding her
with a curious direct look, and the color came to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Does that remark apply to me? If so I will go, for
Captain Drake wants me to play a game of billiards,”
Lady Ethel answered quietly.</p>

<p>“You may stay,” was the impatient answer.</p>

<p>“Thank you; and now I will exercise a sisterly privilege
and give you a little plain talk. I am growing very
fond of John, and I must confess that I am rather sorry
for him. It appears to me that you are playing rather a
dangerous game with him. The poor man is madly in
love with you, but I think that he has just about reached
the end of his patience. I wonder if you would mind
telling me if you really care for him—or——”</p>

<p>“I think that is rather beyond even a sisterly privilege,”
Lady Mildred answered distantly. “Wouldn’t it
be wiser to pay a little more attention to your own affairs,
and leave me to manage my own? There are two
men who are madly in love with you, and you flirt with
them outrageously. Yet you tell <em>me</em> that I am playing
a dangerous game.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean Mr. Drake and his brother?”
Lady Ethel replied calmly. “I quite admit that I have
flirted with Captain Drake, but as to the parson——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Parsons aren’t exactly in my line,” she continued
recklessly. “I think Captain Drake is charming, so refreshing
after all the stupid people that one meets every
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Doubtless he is charming, but very poor.”</p>

<p>“And what of that?” Lady Ethel asked defiantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing, unless you mean to marry him. You are
like myself, hardly the kind of woman to live in comparative
poverty. Of course John would make a good
settlement, when you——”</p>

<p>“John can wait till he is asked. I certainly should
never think of accepting anything from a man who is
being treated so badly by my sister.”</p>

<p>“Ethel, you are impertinent,” Lady Mildred replied
angrily.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but I was only paying you back in your
own coin. But don’t let us quarrel, dear. I can see that
John is utterly miserable, and you don’t strike me as
being a very happy woman. Ah, here is ‘King Baby.’
Give him to me, nurse,” Lady Ethel cried eagerly and
held out her arms.</p>

<p>The nurse retired, and Lady Mildred watched her
sister as she held the child in her arms, crooning the
while a lullaby.</p>

<p>“Mildred, you ought to be the happiest woman in the
world. You’ve a husband who adores you, and this
mite of humanity. I would give my soul to have such a
wee little thing clutching at me and knowing that it was
mine,” Lady Ethel said impulsively.</p>

<p>“You are right, dear. I ought to be happy, yet I am
utterly miserable. Give me the baby.”</p>

<p>And if the fashionable world could have seen Lady
Mildred take the child in her arms with the love-light of
a mother in her eyes, they would have wondered greatly.</p>

<p>Tears glistened on her lashes, and her bosom rose and
fell quickly. She was crying quietly and could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
given no reason why she wept, for knowledge had not
yet come. But Lady Ethel knew, and would have
spoken but instinct bade her keep silent; so she crossed
over, and gently kissed her sister.</p>

<p>“Let us send for nurse to take baby and we will go
down-stairs. They are all in the library,” she said gently,
and Lady Mildred did not resist.</p>

<p>They walked arm in arm down the broad staircase,
and Lady Ethel whispered earnestly.</p>

<p>“Dearest, be yourself to John. Let him see what is
in your heart and all will be right. I am much younger
than you, but I think that I am wiser; for I have learned
that there is only one thing in the world that matters—love,”
she said softly.</p>

<p>“Do you care for Captain Drake?”</p>

<p>But Lady Ethel only smiled, yet there was a flush on
her face when they entered the library.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Gaunt?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“He has gone into the City and won’t be back until
dinner time,” Edward Drake answered.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and play the promised game of
billiards?” his brother asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Mr. Drake can mark for us. Come along,
Mildred,” Lady Ethel cried peremptorily, and her sister
followed obediently.</p>

<p>And the room rang with merry laughter, but Edward
Drake was very quiet, only now and then exchanging a
remark with Lady Mildred. He watched his brother
and Lady Ethel, and it seemed to him that they might
have been made for one another, with their good looks
and high spirits. Yes, there was jealousy in his heart,
but he had thrust it down with all his strength, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
believed that he would rejoice in his brother’s happiness.
Not for a moment did he imagine that this happy girl
could so encourage Lindsay’s attentions if she did not
care for him. Unworldly, it did not occur to him that
lack of money might prove to be an unsurmountable
obstacle to <em>their</em> marriage. Their family was as good as
any in the land—sound stock, descending from the
Francis Drake that had made the land ring with his fame
in the days of the Armada.</p>

<p>And yet he loved Lady Ethel with all the strength and
passion of the reserved man who conceals his feelings.
A faint sigh escaped him, and Lady Mildred looked up;
but she made no remark when she saw the expression in
his eyes as they eagerly followed her sister.</p>

<p>A footman entered and approached Lady Mildred.</p>

<p>“Baron de Croiseuil wishes to see your ladyship,” he
announced.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred uttered an exclamation of surprise as
she rose from her seat.</p>

<p>“I did not know that he was in England. I wonder
what he wants? Take him to the drawing-room, James,”
she said and walked towards the door.</p>

<p>But Edward Drake interrupted her quickly.</p>

<p>“Please let me see the Baron for you,” he said nervously.</p>

<p>She stared at him in astonishment, for she deemed his
request an impertinence.</p>

<p>“I will see him myself. Some time ago I knew him
rather well,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“Please let me see him, Lady Mildred. Perhaps I can
guess why he has come and——”</p>

<p>“Pray finish what you have to say,” she cried when he
hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“And I think that it would be wiser if I went to him.
I speak as your husband’s friend,” he cried imploringly.</p>

<p>“You speak very strangely, Mr. Drake. Please let
me pass.”</p>

<p>He realized that it was useless to insist further, and
uttering an exclamation of disappointment, drew back.
If Edward Drake had had a greater knowledge of the
feminine character, he would have understood that he had
taken the very course to make Lady Mildred see the
Baron, for he had succeeded in arousing her curiosity.</p>

<p>The Baron was already in the drawing-room, and
hastened forward to greet her, a pleasant smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to meet you once more, Lady
Mildred. It has always been a great regret that I was
not able to be present at your marriage, especially as Mr.
Gaunt was once a great friend of mine,” he said effusively.</p>

<p>“I was not aware of the friendship,” she answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes. In the days when we were in the Congo. In
fact, I was one of the first to meet your husband when
he arrived, and I think I helped him to success.”</p>

<p>“My husband does not talk much to me about those
days.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity that he does not carry out the same
rule with regard to the rest of the world. Of course you
know of these speeches he has been making?” the Baron
remarked casually.</p>

<p>“I was present at the first of them. Now I think I
understand the reason of your call. It was not entirely
for the pleasure of seeing me,” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“You are right, Lady Mildred, but it was from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
friendly feeling towards yourself. I have very pleasant
recollections of our former friendship.”</p>

<p>“Our relations scarcely amounted to friendship,” she
interrupted him.</p>

<p>“That is an unkind remark, but I forgive it. Still, my
feelings towards you are those of a friend. <em>Helas!</em>
they would have been different had I been a younger
man.”</p>

<p>She flushed angrily, for compliments she detested, but
she remained silent.</p>

<p>“I have called to see if it is not possible to prevent a
state of affairs from arising that will be extremely distasteful
to you.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind. But please explain.”</p>

<p>“You know that my interests are closely bound up
with the Congo? The speeches that your husband is
making are injuring my interests, and they must stop
immediately. If they do not, I fear that Mr. Gaunt and
incidentally yourself will suffer. I implore you to use
all your influence with him, Lady Mildred,” he said
earnestly.</p>

<p>“In what way will my husband suffer?” she asked
calmly, but there was an angry light in her eyes that he
did not perceive.</p>

<p>“It is a delicate matter, and I hate even to hint at it;
but it is for your sake, and I will only say that there are
many things in your husband’s past that will not bear
the light of day. For my part I should do my best to
keep them secret, but unfortunately there are others.”</p>

<p>Again that expressive shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred crossed the room and pressed the button
of the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“It is for your sake, Lady Mildred, and——”</p>

<p>The footman came in and Lady Mildred turned to
him.</p>

<p>“Please show this gentleman from the house, and in
the future I am not at home to him.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved away, and her face was eloquent
of contempt.</p>

<p>The Baron hesitated and then, with a final shrug, left
the room without saying another word, for he recognized
that he was defeated.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was with a feeling of great anxiety that Edward
Drake saw Lady Mildred leave the billiard room to
go to Baron de Croiseuil, for he quickly guessed
the reason of the Belgian’s visit. Although Gaunt had
not gone into details it was evident from what he had
said that there was much in his Congo past that he would
not care to have reach his wife’s ears. By all accounts the
Baron was a most unscrupulous adversary, and would not
hesitate to use the knowledge that he possessed.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ thought, Drake hastened to the
telephone and got into communication with the city
office, only to find that Gaunt was not there.</p>

<p>“Please ask him to come to Park Lane as soon as he
returns,” Drake said to Foster the secretary, and then
went back to the billiard room.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel was idly knocking about the billiard balls,
and she did not look up when he entered.</p>

<p>“Where is my brother?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He suddenly remembered that he had an appointment
at the war office,” she answered, as she deftly made a
cannon. “This is a good chance for the lesson I promised
to give you,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>Drake went to the rack from which he took the first
cue that came to hand.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that you will find me rather a duffer,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Your education has been neglected—in many ways.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
Then she gave him a quick look which he failed to catch.
“You may break.”</p>

<p>But Drake’s hand trembled, and he made a miscue.</p>

<p>“Try again,” she said lightly, and placed the ball back
in balk.</p>

<p>Again he tried to make the shot, with a similar result.</p>

<p>“It is no use, I am an awful duffer,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p>She watched him as he replaced the cue in the rack,
and her eyes twinkled with mischief.</p>

<p>“You are very easily discouraged. I thought better
things of you, Mr. Drake,” she said with a laugh, but
suddenly her face became grave and she approached
more closely to him. “Would you mind telling me why
you did not wish my sister to see the Baron de Croiseuil?”</p>

<p>Drake knew not what to say, for he could not tell her
the real reason.</p>

<p>“I do not ask merely from curiosity. I am not quite
a fool, although you may think that my intelligence
is below the average, and I am not blind to what is going
on. It seems to me that my sister and her husband are
drifting apart and that you know the reason of it,” she
said with unusual seriousness.</p>

<p>Still he did not answer, and she grew impatient.</p>

<p>“Am I not right? Mr. Gaunt has changed in a
marvellous way since he has known you—and I wish
you to take me into your confidence.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do so, Lady Ethel. I shall be grateful if you
will change the subject. All I can say is that I will spare
no effort to prevent any disagreement between Mr. Gaunt
and his wife. But there are great issues at stake, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Lady Mildred must not be the only consideration,” he
said earnestly.</p>

<p>“No issue can be so great as my sister’s happiness,”
she answered impetuously.</p>

<p>“I do not agree with you, Lady Ethel. Please don’t
say any more,” he said appealingly.</p>

<p>“I won’t for the present, but I am disappointed in
you. Your brother would not have answered as you
have done.”</p>

<p>His face flushed, and he took a step towards her. Her
eyes regarded him steadily, and their expression contained
a hint of defiance.</p>

<p>“My brother would only do what is consistent with
honor,” he answered with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>A silence followed, and both were conscious of a feeling
of nervousness. Edward Drake came to a sudden
decision, and spoke impulsively.</p>

<p>“My brother is the only relative that I have in the
world, and we are more than brothers, for we are friends.
Lindsay is as generous-hearted a man as ever breathed,
and I have never known him guilty of a mean action.
Lady Ethel, he is very dear to me, and I should grieve
to see him hurt. Perhaps I ought not to speak to you
in this way, but I think that you understand what I
mean. For some years he has lived among savages, and
the life there has made him forget many things. During
these last few days he has only remembered that he
is a man, and you a woman. Your beauty has blinded
him to the fact that he is a poverty-stricken soldier,
while you are a lady of title, who——”</p>

<p>While he spoke the color had left her cheeks, and she
interrupted him peremptorily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think that you might allow your brother to
speak for himself? You parsons imagine that it is your
prerogative to meddle in affairs that do not in the least
concern you.”</p>

<p>“My brother’s happiness concerns me greatly,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he old enough to look after himself? You are a
strange man, Mr. Drake, and just a little bit impertinent.
Of course, I use the word in its classical sense,” she added
hastily.</p>

<p>He smiled, but it was a sad smile, and she relented
immediately.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need be troubled about your brother’s
happiness,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>As he asked the question he was conscious of a fierce
pain tugging at his heart, for he dreaded to hear her
answer.</p>

<p>“I mean—nothing,” she cried gaily.</p>

<p>The door was thrown open and Gaunt strode in,
putting an end to the conversation.</p>

<p>“I got your message. What is it?” he asked quickly
of Drake.</p>

<p>The latter glanced significantly at Lady Ethel who
understood his meaning.</p>

<p>“I will relieve you of my presence, and I hope that
I have completely reassured you.”</p>

<p>The last sentence was addressed to Drake, and was
spoken so mockingly that he winced, and the color came
to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Gaunt demanded as soon as
they were alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>There was a worried look on his face, and it seemed
to Drake that there were lines around his eyes that he
had not before noticed.</p>

<p>“Baron de Croiseuil called this afternoon, and Lady
Mildred insisted upon seeing him. They may be together
now.”</p>

<p>Gaunt smothered an oath, as he crossed the room to
ring the bell, and no word was spoken until the footman
came.</p>

<p>“Is your mistress alone?” Gaunt demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Has the Baron de Croiseuil gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. About a quarter of an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“You can go, James,” Gaunt said to the footman, and
as soon as the latter had left the room he sank back into
a chair with a groan.</p>

<p>“Is it very serious, what he might say to Lady
Mildred?” Drake asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Lady Mildred will consider it more than serious. But
don’t talk for a few minutes. I want to do some hard
thinking.”</p>

<p>It was a quarter of an hour before Gaunt sprang to
his feet, and there was the light of battle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Sit down, father confessor, while I tell you the whole
story,” he said with a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>“There was a man named Marillier on the Congo. A
blackguard of the worst description, and soon after I
arrived in the country we came into contact. He was
the most callous of all the brutes that go to make up
Congo officialdom, and in those days I was not inured
to sickening sights. One day I went to his station, and
found him with his own hand flogging a young girl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
about fifteen, one of his numerous native wives. He
used the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicotte</i>, a murderous instrument of torture, and
the girl was half dead. I lost my temper, and seized the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chicotte</i> with which I gave him a little of what he had
been giving the girl.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” Drake cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“I took the poor girl on to my own station, and that
night Marillier turned up in a drunken rage. In his
hand he carried a revolver, and commenced firing at me.
I had no desire to die, so I took my own weapon and
fired.”</p>

<p>Gaunt paused, and his breath came quickly.</p>

<p>“My shot reached home, and he died.”</p>

<p>“You were justified by every moral law,” Drake said
quietly.</p>

<p>“So the officials seemed to think who investigated the
matter, for I heard no more about it until last night
when the Baron visited me,” Gaunt said grimly.</p>

<p>“I am confident that Lady Mildred will hold you
justified when she hears your side of the story.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, but that isn’t the worst from her point of
view. There is only one thing that I dread her hearing,
and the Baron knows it.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” Drake asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a pretty story, but you’d better know it. Of
course you can’t appreciate the code of morality that
exists in West Africa. Nearly all the white men out
there have native wives. In fact, many of the Congo
officials have half a dozen. From the woman’s point
of view, it is a valid marriage and her status is raised
thereby. You can guess what is coming,” Gaunt said
miserably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“You had a native wife?”</p>

<p>“No. But the general belief throughout the Congo
was that I had taken Marillier’s native wife and that that
was the reason why he had attacked me. But there is
no necessity to go into details, and I will simply say that
while I was on the Congo, I lived a clean life, as far as
women are concerned. You know Lady Mildred, and if
the Baron should tell her——”</p>

<p>Gaunt broke off, and turned away so that Drake
should not see the misery in his eyes. The latter had
listened to this recital in dismay, for he saw clearly that
Lady Mildred would be deeply hurt should the Baron
have told this story, and he could say no word of comfort.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak? Do you think that I have
lied to you?” Gaunt demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>“No. Of course I believe you, but I fear that your
enemies have a powerful weapon. The Baron may
honestly believe that you killed Marillier on account of
the woman, but——” He ceased to speak, and his face
cleared. “I don’t think the Baron will have told Lady
Mildred, yet; for he will hold it in reserve to use against
you. Why don’t you go to her yourself at once and tell
her? Hearing it from you she might believe, while if
the knowledge came from a stranger—there would
always remain a suspicion.”</p>

<p>“You have set me a hard task, and I don’t think that
I have the strength to carry it out,” Gaunt said dully.</p>

<p>“Believe me, it is the best plan—the only one,”
Drake said impetuously.</p>

<p>Gaunt did not answer, but stared moodily into the fire
and the silence became oppressive, but soon there was a
knock at the door and a footman entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Her ladyship would like to see you in her room,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“Now is your chance,” Drake whispered earnestly.</p>

<p>But Gaunt did not move.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lady Mildred</span> was thoroughly upset by the
interview with Baron de Croiseuil, for she realized
that a grave warning had been given her.
When her anger subsided, it was only natural that she
should be curious about her husband’s past life in the
Congo, and although she knew that Gaunt had been no
saint, it was difficult to believe that he had ever done
anything to warrant the Baron’s thinly disguised threat.
Not for a moment did she regret the attitude she had
taken up; indeed, pride had left no alternative, but all
the same she was conscious of a feeling of uneasiness,
and looked forward with impatience to meeting her
husband.</p>

<p>She waited restlessly for the footman whom she had
sent to see if he had returned.</p>

<p>“Did you give Mr. Gaunt my message?” she asked
when he appeared.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Is he coming?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt did not say. He is in the billiard room
with Mr. Drake.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” she said by way of dismissal.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, and when Gaunt did not
arrive, her uneasiness increased; but at last he appeared,
and she at once noticed a strangeness in his manner.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I have been so long,” he began apologetically;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
but he was regarding her anxiously, to see if he
could gather from her attitude whether the Baron had
spoken.</p>

<p>“I had a visit from the Baron de Croiseuil this afternoon.
But won’t you sit down, John?” she said nervously.</p>

<p>Gaunt was inclined to think that she was still in ignorance
of what he dreaded that she should hear, and a
quick sigh of relief escaped him.</p>

<p>“What did the Baron want? You will understand that
he is not exactly my friend,” he said very quietly.</p>

<p>“So I gathered from my interview, for he spoke very
plainly about these speeches you have been making. I
am afraid that you will find him an active enemy if you
continue to interest yourself in the Congo.”</p>

<p>“The Baron and I have already discussed that matter
at some length, and we were unable to arrive at an
agreement. I presume he came to ask you to persuade
me to keep my mouth shut?” Gaunt said grimly.</p>

<p>“You are right, and he did not mince matters.”</p>

<p>“It is his habit to be blunt where bluntness suits his
purpose. May I ask what line he took?” he said
casually, but Lady Mildred could see that he was very
anxious.</p>

<p>“It appears that you left rather an unsavory record
behind in the Congo, and he suggested that his friends
might find it necessary to see that your past was resuscitated.
He spoke in a perfectly friendly way, and pretended
that he had come out of consideration for myself,
imagining that some of the mud which would be thrown
at you might stick upon myself,” she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I see,” he answered reflectively, and then paused for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
a while. “Would you mind telling me how you answered
him?”</p>

<p>“I rang for the footman, and gave orders that in future
I should not be at home if he called,” she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face lighted up wonderfully, and she blushed
at the sight of the emotion that her answer had conjured
up.</p>

<p>“That was good of you, Mildred. But you could not
have acted differently. About this black record of mine
on the Congo; weren’t you curious to know of what it
consisted? Didn’t you ask him for particulars?”</p>

<p>“I was curious, I admit, but I would not lower myself
by questioning him,” she answered proudly.</p>

<p>“And you still are curious?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the answer came reluctantly.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, but Gaunt quickly turned away to
conceal the struggle that was taking place in his mind.
Now was the opportunity of making his confession; but
when he remembered its sordid nature, the words refused
to come. In his imagination he could see the look of
loathing that would come to her face, and suddenly he
determined that at all costs she must remain in ignorance
of the fact that he had killed a man, and might be
charged with the crime of murder.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you would be content to remain in ignorance?
I must admit that before I met you, I did many
things that you would condemn, but I would rather that
you remained in ignorance of them. Knowledge can do
no good. Do I ask too much?” he said eagerly.</p>

<p>It was clear to him that she was disappointed by his
request and he waited anxiously for her to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“John, I feel that I am becoming surrounded by mystery,”
she cried impetuously. “If we are driven apart—which
God forbid!—it will be because you refuse to give
me your confidence. I am going to ask you a favor, and
I want you to think carefully before you give me an answer.
The other day I wished you to take me away at
once and you refused. It is not an easy matter for me
to repeat the request; but I do so, and very earnestly,
for I believe that if we were alone for a while, all this
foolish suspicion would vanish, and——”</p>

<p>“And——?” he repeated dully when she hesitated.</p>

<p>“It is difficult for me to speak of the new feeling
which has crept into my heart, but I believe that I could
love you, if you would allow me to do so.”</p>

<p>“Mildred,” he cried hoarsely, and rising, held out his
arms towards her.</p>

<p>“No, John. Before that, everything must be clear
and straightforward. I must confess that I cannot understand
why you are waging this war on the Congo officials,
for it is not your nature to turn upon those who
were once your friends, and who helped you to your
present position. I want to know why you are doing
so. Have you suddenly become religious, and is it
from a sense of duty?”</p>

<p>Gaunt shook his head, and his depression increased.</p>

<p>“There must be some very forceful reason, for you are
running a great risk. The Baron will certainly do all
the mischief that he can. Perhaps he will publish your
record, and that will not be very pleasant for either of
us. And there’s baby to be considered.”</p>

<p>Her voice sank and contained a note of awe when she
spoke the last sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“I am willing to sink my curiosity—which is something
for a woman to sacrifice. I am willing to do anything
you like, so long as you will promise to come away
with me,” she said with quiet earnestness.</p>

<p>Gaunt was moved, and for a moment was sorely tempted
to agree to what she proposed, whatever might be the
consequences. It must be remembered that he loved his
wife passionately, and that she was offering him all that
he desired—her love. A few weeks ago he would have
been overjoyed and his happiness would have been complete—but
now——</p>

<p>His bond was stronger than his love. The temptation
was ruthlessly swept aside, and there was born a determination
which in the future should be his guide with
reference to his wife—he would not accept her love unless
he could come to her with perfectly clean hands, and
that could not be until his fight for the Congo natives
was finished. Mud would be thrown at him, and his
reputation might be blackened, but when the struggle
was over, and she would know the worst—save perhaps
that one thing which he must keep from her at all costs.</p>

<p>Now she was offering him her love, and should he pass
it by, might it not be refused him later on? Lady Mildred
was proud and would feel deeply his refusal; but
there seemed to be no alternative, and he braced himself
up to speak.</p>

<p>“I would give all that I possess in the world to be
able to do what you wish, but I cannot,” he said desperately.</p>

<p>“And I may not know the reason?” she said coldly,
and her face had grown very white.</p>

<p>“I can only tell you that my honor is bound up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
Congo. You yourself encouraged me to undo some
of the harm for which I was responsible. I have
vowed——”</p>

<p>He broke off and turned away so that she should not
see his emotion.</p>

<p>“I have vowed not to turn back,” he continued more
firmly. “And I cannot break my word. You would
not respect me if I did so.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say? Do you intend to turn
me deliberately out of your life?” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>“Mildred—I can only ask you to be patient and to
trust me.”</p>

<p>There was a world of appeal in his voice, but now she
had hardened her heart against him, and was unaffected.</p>

<p>“I love you body and soul, and if you only knew what
your offer meant to me—a happiness so intense as almost
to amount to pain. Since we first met, my whole object
in life has been to win your love. During all our months
of married life your indifference was a torture; but I was
determined to be patient, for the ultimate reward was
worth any sacrifice. And then came the baby. My
hopes rose, and——”</p>

<p>“You tell me that you love me, and yet you refuse my
request. You stultify yourself, John. Love that cannot
make this little sacrifice is unworthy of the name.”</p>

<p>“Sacrifice,” he repeated vehemently. “There is no
sacrifice that I would not gladly make for the happiness
of which you have given me a glimpse.”</p>

<p>“John.”</p>

<p>Her face had softened wondrously, and she held out
her hand towards him. It appeared to Gaunt that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
wife had never been so beautiful, and the temptation to
take her in his arms became maddening.</p>

<p>“John,” she repeated softly.</p>

<p>“Don’t tempt me, Mildred. You do not know what
you are doing. If I were to accept, I should never know
a moment’s happiness. My soul would be eternally
damned, and I could never look into your eyes without
feeling ashamed. No, I will play the game, and you
shall have an honest man for husband, and not a poltroon,”
he cried vehemently.</p>

<p>She realized that he was deeply moved and that the
words were wrung from him, but she could not understand,
and without understanding could give him no
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Again this mystery, John. What does it mean?”
she asked wearily. But he would not reply, but turned
away to the window through which he stared moodily.
The reaction had set in and he longed to be alone, for
the sight of her tormented him, reminding him of what
he was thrusting from his life.</p>

<p>At last he looked round, and found that she had gone.
With a savage laugh he stepped into the middle of the
room, but suddenly his eyes alighted upon a small lace
handkerchief which lay on the floor. It was the work
of an instant to pick it up and place it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Down-stairs to the library he went, and there found
Edward Drake, who was reading an evening newspaper.</p>

<p>“Have you told her?” Drake asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t intend to do so,” Gaunt cried
harshly.</p>

<p>“Then God help you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Gaunt laughed, but there was no mirth in the sound.</p>

<p>“I shall need your prayers and His help,” he said, and
then sank back into the chair, covering his face with his
hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">John Gaunt</span> sat motionless while Drake looked
at him with eyes that were brimming over with
sympathy, for it was easy for him to guess what
had occurred. Although disappointed that his advice
had not been followed, he could not greatly blame the
millionaire for having lacked the courage to make a confession
that might have estranged him from his wife
forever.</p>

<p>“You are addressing another meeting to-night. It
will soon be time to dress,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“You expect me to speak to-night, when my soul is
tortured? Have you no pity, man? Do you realize
what the carrying out of this vow means to me? I have
but to break it and all my difficulties vanish. Drake, I
am beginning to think I must give in,” he wound up
wearily.</p>

<p>The passion had vanished and a great anguish of mind
had taken its place, for he had been thinking, and it
seemed as though he had signed the death warrant of
his happiness by refusing his wife’s request. Even the
strongest men have moments of weakness and Gaunt
lost grip of his purpose, revealing himself as he had
never before done to human being.</p>

<p>“You, Drake, are a cold-blooded saint—a man
untouched by thought of woman and you cannot
imagine the awful longing which is in me. I worship my
wife, and every fibre of my being longs for her. Now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
must forego my desire, and——By Heaven! I can’t do
it. To hell with the Congo, for I’ve done with its
suffering niggers,” he cried recklessly.</p>

<p>Drake’s face was white and drawn, his lips moved but
no words could be heard during the breathless silence
that followed.</p>

<p>“I’m not an archangel and I can’t rise to your heights.
It is my nature to sink and——What am I saying?”
Gaunt broke off abruptly, and wildly brushed his hand
across his forehead.</p>

<p>Edward Drake’s breath came quickly but still he
would not speak and, approaching Gaunt, affectionately
placed his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I, too, love as you do, and I understand. Gaunt,
you are my friend, and I am proud of it. I believe in
you, and know that you do not mean the words that you
have spoken. During the last few days I have been
filled with admiration for the things you have done.
You have shown courage of a high order. You made a
vow and you have carried it out in the spirit and the
letter. Gaunt, you will not weaken, I implore you.
Remember the good that you have already done. You
are rousing England from its lethargy, and you only
have to continue to win the battle. Think of it, Gaunt.
You can save the natives from torture and make them
free men. Could mortal man have a nobler task?”</p>

<p>He spoke with deep feeling, but his words were
unheeded.</p>

<p>“Can you blame me if I give way? On the one
hand is the love of my wife and on the other a bitter
fight that may lose me every friend that I possess. In a
few days the country may ring with the things that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
have done, and my wife may be ashamed at the mention
of my name. You deliberately ask me to make this
sacrifice, and for what? For a promise made in a
moment of dire distress, when I scarcely knew what I
was saying,” Gaunt cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“For a promise made to God,” Drake said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>His face showed signs of a great emotion, and
suddenly he sank to his knees and prayed aloud.</p>

<p>“I pray you to give this man courage to endure, so
that this great good can be accomplished.”</p>

<p>And then his voice sank, so that Gaunt could not
catch the fervent words he uttered. But Drake’s action
of falling on to his knees had recalled the millionaire to
his senses, for it brought vividly back to his mind the
night of anguish when he had made the vow. And
soon the weakness passed and he became once more the
strong man, so that he was ashamed of the words that
he had spoken.</p>

<p>Drake rose to his feet, and his face was still very
white, but when he saw the change in Gaunt, he gave a
glad cry and ran towards him.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” he cried fervently and held forth his
hand.</p>

<p>Gaunt did not speak at once but looked curiously at
the man who was exerting such an influence on his life.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Drake. Please forget this pitiable scene,
and I promise you that it sha’n’t occur again. I was a
little upset, and——”</p>

<p>“Say no more. You have fought a bitter fight and
won.”</p>

<p>“I think it was the sight of you praying that gave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
strength to conquer.” Then he glanced hastily at his
watch. “You were quite right. It is time to dress,” he
said quickly, and Drake knew that the subject must
never again be mentioned between them.</p>

<p>They met again at dinner, and Gaunt was relieved
that his wife was absent. Lady Ethel and Captain
Drake did most of the talking, and the former declared
her intention of accompanying the others to the meeting.</p>

<p>“My sister is tired, and I shall be all alone. May I
not come?” she asked Gaunt who looked doubtfully at
her.</p>

<p>But she persisted and when consent was finally given,
she ran away to get ready.</p>

<p>That night Gaunt surpassed himself, and his words
caused a deep impression on the vast crowd that was
present. The emotion of the afternoon had not entirely
left him, and perhaps it was that which gave him
additional eloquence, so that there were many moist
eyes when he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel was amazed at the earnestness of her
brother-in-law, and she gave a quick look at Edward
Drake.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt has spoken as one inspired,” she said in a
low voice. “Are you responsible for his joining in this
crusade?”</p>

<p>“No; but I share his desire to help the Congo people.
If I had his gift of eloquence, I should be only too glad
to speak as he is doing. Don’t you admire him for it?”
he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“I am thinking of my sister, while you think only of
the Congo,” she answered gravely, and then lapsed into
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>But when they were home again she returned to the
subject.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” she said to Drake, “and answer me one
question. Why is Mr. Gaunt doing this? I am sure
it is not solely from a philanthropic motive, and I
believe that you are at the bottom of it. I cannot deny
that it is a good work, and I am filled with pity for the
poor natives who are so cruelly treated. But from my
knowledge of Mr. Gaunt’s character, he is not the man
to concern himself with such a thing. In fact, I used to
imagine him to be rather a bad lot in a respectable sort
of way. Before he became engaged to my sister, I
received many letters from friends, and they were not all
filled with complimentary references to the man who was
thought likely to become my brother-in-law. It seems
to me that he is dreadfully worried about something
and that something has to do with the Congo.
You must not think that I cannot be serious and I tell
you that I am very anxious to help my sister and
her husband. Take me into your confidence, Mr.
Drake—two heads are better than one,” she said
appealingly.</p>

<p>“I would willingly do so, Lady Ethel, but I have no
right to speak without Mr. Gaunt’s consent. In a way I
am his servant,” he answered regretfully.</p>

<p>Drake gave a sigh of relief when Gaunt entered accompanied
by Captain Drake.</p>

<p>“I want a chat with you,” the former said to him, and
he rose so promptly that Lady Ethel smiled.</p>

<p>“You welcome the interruption,” she said coldly, and
then turned graciously to Captain Drake, who had occupied
the chair vacated by his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a ripping meeting? I think Mr. Gaunt
spoke splendidly,” the latter said eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes. He certainly aroused great enthusiasm. But
do you think it will do much material good? Things
will go on as before, and the natives will suffer just the
same,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure about that, for it is evident that
England is waking up. The papers are pitching it a bit
more strongly, and who knows that we may not be able
to force the government to move.”</p>

<p>“You seem almost as enthusiastic as your brother and
Mr. Gaunt,” she remarked, and gave him a quick look from
beneath her lashes, which brought the color to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I have been doing a great deal of hard thinking since
I came back from West Africa. I never was a serious
kind of chap like Edward, but I’ve always admired him.
He has a wonderful way with him, and has compelled
me to see things through his own eyes. Of course I
have always known that the state of affairs in the Congo
was a crying scandal, but it never worried me much till I
heard Mr. Gaunt speak. Now I am with them heart
and soul,” he cried earnestly.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what made my brother-in-law take
up the Congo question?” she asked casually.</p>

<p>“There can be only one reason. He is acting from
conviction,” he answered wonderingly.</p>

<p>“If you really think that, then you don’t know John
Gaunt. So they haven’t taken you into their confidence?”
she said reflectively.</p>

<p>“What other reason could there possibly be?”</p>

<p>“That is just what I want to find out. Ask your
brother, and let me know what he says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“I will certainly do so, but I am sure that I am right.
Mr. Gaunt is a ‘white’ man and could have no ulterior
purpose in what he is doing. Besides, my brother would
not be his friend if everything were not straightforward,”
he continued stoutly.</p>

<p>“There I agree with you,” Lady Ethel broke in quickly.
“And I do not suggest that his motive is an unworthy
one. Your brother had practically admitted that a motive
does exist, but he refuses to tell me what it is. Now I
am not anxious to know merely from a sense of curiosity,
but to help my sister, for she is very worried. Will you
do your best to find out what it is and then let me know?”</p>

<p>Captain Drake looked at her, and there was intense
surprise in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Would it be quite right that I should tell you when
Edward does not wish you to know? I mean, should I
be acting straightforwardly if I did so?” he suggested
gently.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel jumped to her feet and it was evident that
she was annoyed.</p>

<p>“Captain Drake, you ought to have been a member
of your brother’s profession. You are only fit for the
Church. I did think that I could rely on you,” she said
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“You can rely on me, Lady Ethel; I would gladly
lay down my life to serve you,” he answered simply, and
although the words may have been melodramatic, his
manner of speaking made them sound natural.</p>

<p>“And yet you refuse this one little request—the first
that I have ever made to you,” she answered ironically.</p>

<p>“I am disappointed that you should have asked me to
do such a thing. It was not worthy of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>Their eyes met, and though his contained not a hint
of reproach, she resented that he should dare to judge
her actions.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said curtly and hastened towards
the door.</p>

<p>“Lady Ethel,” he began hurriedly, but her only answer
was to close the door rather sharply; and he sank
back into his chair with a sigh.</p>

<p>“After all, she is only a child,” he muttered.</p>

<p>And soon a smile came to his face, for he was remembering
her many virtues, and he loved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">By</span> the following morning John Gaunt had decided
upon his plan of campaign and without any
delay started to work by communicating with
the secretary of the Congo Reform Association. Money
was to be spent lavishly, and capable speakers were
chosen to speak in different parts of the country. Gaunt
himself was to go to the great centres and his visits were
to be advertised in every possible way. The secretary
eagerly welcomed this new ally, and threw himself with
energy into the task of making the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>“I suggest that we bombard the papers with articles,
and if there is any difficulty in getting them inserted, I
am prepared to pay the advertisement rates,” Gaunt said
grimly.</p>

<p>Edward Drake was present at the interview, and rejoiced
to see that Gaunt no longer hesitated, but was
now even more determined to fulfil his vow.</p>

<p>“I should like these articles to be sent out at once—to-day
if possible,” Gaunt continued quickly.</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” the secretary answered promptly.</p>

<p>For years he had waged a war against overwhelming
odds and now he began to hope that success was in
sight. Always he had lacked the help of such a man as
Gaunt, with his millions, and he thanked Providence for
his good fortune, but still, like the rest of the world, he
could not quite understand why the millionaire had
thrown himself into the fray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Gaunt had devoted his brains to planning out the best
way of rousing the country, and no detail was too small
for his consideration. It was after a hard but satisfactory
day’s work that he returned home with Drake, and during
the drive was wondering how he would be received
by his wife. They did not meet until dinner time, and
Lady Mildred showed him quite plainly but politely that
she had not forgiven him for having refused to go away
in the yacht.</p>

<p>In fact, during the meal, they were all conscious of a
feeling of embarrassment, and it was a relief when the
ladies left them to their cigars. Gaunt only spoke in answer
to a question, for he was thinking over his position,
and it seemed to him that the crisis must be very near at
hand. The few hours of grace given to him by the
Baron had elapsed, and it would not be long before his
enemies made a move.</p>

<p>The next morning the newspapers were brought to
him at an early hour, and the first thing that caught his
eye was the front page of the <cite>Daily Comet</cite>, with its staring
head-lines:</p>

<p>“<em>Gaunt and the Congo.</em>”</p>

<p>And then he proceeded to read a bitter attack upon
himself, and was forced to admit that the article had
been written with the greatest skill, for it consisted of insinuations
against his character which it would be difficult
to rebut. The deal in Amanti shares was referred
to in veiled terms, although to those on the inside the
meaning was quite clear. The writer proceeded to refer
to Gaunt’s life in the Congo, and the words which followed
were pungent.</p>

<p>“This millionaire has allied himself with the Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
perhaps in the hope that the friendship of bishops would
cause to be forgotten the means by which he gained his
ill-gotten wealth. As we write there is before us a written
record of this man’s life in the Congo, and it seems
incredible that he can have the effrontery to pretend that
his aim is the betterment of the race that he himself has
persecuted so atrociously.</p>

<p>“Why has John Gaunt started this campaign? We
confess that we are unable to answer the question, and
until we can do so, it is impossible to believe in his good
faith. Philanthropy is the last charge which we should
think of bringing against him, and we fear that he can
only be animated by some motive that will ultimately
benefit himself. It has been suggested that he is anxious
to bring about European intervention, in the hope that
he will be rewarded by the grant of valuable concessions.”</p>

<p>Gaunt could read no more but threw down the paper
in disgust, and he had no doubt that the Baron was responsible
for this virulent attack. Another paper attracted
his attention; the whole of the front page, which
was usually occupied by advertisements, contained a
statement upon the Congo question. It was written
without any exaggeration, and plainly placed before the
public the true state of affairs, laying special stress upon
the manner in which the Belgians were deceiving
Europe.</p>

<p>There were very few papers that did not contain a
similar article, inserted as advertisements and paid for
with Gaunt’s money.</p>

<p>“Now I think that the fight has really commenced,
and it won’t be long before the Baron makes an answering
move,” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Edward Drake came in; under his
arm was a bundle of newspapers, and he smiled when he
saw those that Gaunt had thrown on the floor.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it splendid? I think we have made a good
start,” he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Do you refer to the article in the <cite>Comet</cite>?” Gaunt
asked drily.</p>

<p>“No one will pay any attention to that ‘rag,’” Drake
answered quickly, and then hesitated for a moment. “I
wonder if you would allow me to tell Lady Ethel everything?
She might be able to help us?” he asked nervously.</p>

<p>A smile came to Gaunt’s face, but he shook his head
with decision.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that curiosity is one of her besetting
weaknesses. I have noticed that she has been very anxious
to find out what is going on, but I think it would
be wiser to allow her curiosity to remain unsatisfied,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that it is idle curiosity,” Drake
said reflectively. “She is very fond of her sister,
and——”</p>

<p>“We will change the subject,” Gaunt said peremptorily,
and Drake realized that it would be dangerous to
persist further.</p>

<p>However, Gaunt was fated to meet with a more strenuous
advocate, for Lady Ethel herself came into the
library.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, I wish to speak to Mr. Gaunt,” she announced
quietly, and then smiled a little maliciously as
he prepared to depart.</p>

<p>“What do you want? I’m busy and haven’t much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
time to spare,” Gaunt said curtly, for he did not approve
of the way in which she had spoken.</p>

<p>“Busy with the wretched Congo, I suppose? At any
rate, you can find time to discuss a matter which affects
the happiness of my sister,” she said slowly. “Unless,
of course, the wretched natives are of more consequence
than your wife,” she added quickly, and there was a
look of defiance on her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you would be wiser to concern
yourself with your own affairs? It would seem probable
that they will require attention, if you go on flirting in
the same reckless manner,” he said significantly.</p>

<p>She flushed hotly and with difficulty suppressed an
angry reply.</p>

<p>“I am not to be bluffed in that way. I have come for
a serious talk and don’t intend to go away until we come
to an understanding,” she said with quiet determination.</p>

<p>“Very well. Say your say and pray get it over as
quickly as possible,” he rejoined with a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>“I passed the nursery just now. Your wife was there,
and she was alone with the baby. She did not see me,
and she was crying bitterly, and tears are nearly strangers
to Mildred’s eyes. Ah! I am glad that affects you a
little. I don’t mean to suggest that she hasn’t faults, but
at heart Mildred is a fine woman. She may have been
selfish, but she is loyal through and through, and I honestly
believe that she has learned to care for you.”</p>

<p>She watched him anxiously, and was encouraged to
proceed, for she noticed that his face had grown white,
and there was a look of utter misery in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I must confess that when I was present at your wedding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
I imagined that she was selling herself to you, for I
could see nothing attractive in your personality; and,
girl as I was, I knew something of the way in which the
world talked of you. All the time I was in France I was
wondering how you were getting on together, and when
I came home a few days ago I was amazed, for I believed
that Mildred cared for you. What I have seen since has
confirmed me in that belief.”</p>

<p>She paused as if expecting him to make some remark,
but Gaunt remained silent.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that you love Mildred. At times I
have seen an expression in your eyes when you have
been talking to her that rather frightened me. But I
think that I should like to be loved in the same way,” she
added pensively, and Gaunt uttered a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>“You love Mildred, and she loves you. That being
so, may I ask what all this wretched fuss is about?” she
demanded angrily.</p>

<p>“I repeat that I think that you had better mind your
own business.”</p>

<p>“I have asked Mildred and she will tell me nothing.
Mr. Drake and his brother have practically admitted that
there is a secret but they won’t tell me what it is. I
could not press them for an answer, but you are
different.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her whole manner changed, softening wondrously.</p>

<p>“John, dear, I like you, for I believe you to be a
good sort. Not exactly the man that I should have
chosen to be Mildred’s husband, but I believe that you
are the only one that could make her happy. I know
you look upon me as a little fool, and perhaps you aren’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
far wrong; but I love Mildred, and hate to see her miserable.
Go to her now, take her in your arms and kiss
her. Pack up your traps and clear off together.”</p>

<p>“I wish to God that I could,” he cried passionately.
“Don’t you realize that I love Mildred body and soul?
And that I long for her in a way that you cannot understand?
Do you think that it was an easy matter to put
her deliberately out of my life? Ethel, it is killing me—this
necessity—and yet I dare not do otherwise. You
are a good little soul to come to me in this way, and I
won’t forget it. Ethel, dear, I, too, want your sympathy,”
he wound up brokenly.</p>

<p>She could see that he was suffering acutely, and immediately
all her sympathy was aroused. She placed
her hand on his shoulder, and bending her head, touched
his forehead with her lips. Gaunt had revealed himself
in a way that had surprised her greatly, for it was impossible
to believe that he was not in deadly earnest, and her
heart sank. The secret, whatever it might be, was evidently
not a thing that could be swept aside easily; it was not
a stupid misunderstanding, caused by stiff-necked pride,
but something serious.</p>

<p>“John, I am sorry, and won’t worry you any more,
but I should like you to know that I am your friend, and
that you can count on me,” she said with simple earnestness.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and a footman entered.</p>

<p>“The Baron de Croiseuil wishes to see you, sir, and
he asked me to say that his business was of the utmost importance.
Her ladyship instructed me that she was ‘not
at home’ should the Baron call, but as you had given me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
no orders, sir, I thought it better to announce the
Baron.”</p>

<p>“You did quite right, James. I will see him here,”
Gaunt answered, but Lady Ethel intervened quickly.</p>

<p>“Don’t see him, John,” she cried appealingly.</p>

<p>Gaunt looked at her curiously, and then glanced at the
footman who still waited.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Baron de Croiseuil had not anticipated that
Gaunt would give in to his threats, but he
waited for the time to expire before taking any
further steps. In the afternoon Sherren came round to
the hotel to receive his instructions, and, in consequence,
the article duly appeared in the <cite>Daily Comet</cite>.</p>

<p>The paper was brought to the Baron’s bedroom the
following morning, and when he read the references to
Gaunt a grim smile came to his face, but his attention
was attracted to the front page of the <cite>Daily Herald</cite>, and
he uttered an exclamation of anger when he had mastered
the advertisements that appeared there.</p>

<p>“So Gaunt has declared war,” he muttered, and threw
the paper impatiently away.</p>

<p>But shortly afterwards he rang the bell, and ordered a
copy of each morning newspaper, only to find that the
majority of them contained similar advertisements. It
was his intention to send for Sherren, but that was unnecessary,
for his satellite arrived just as he was finishing
breakfast. For a long time they discussed the situation
gravely, and it was the Baron who suggested the next
move.</p>

<p>“What is the name of the man who forged the cable?”
he asked of Sherren.</p>

<p>“Davis. I expect that he will arrive at Plymouth this
morning, and I have arranged that Weiss should wire him
to come to London at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien.</i> I wish to see Weiss this afternoon, and it
would be as well if you try to get hold of Davis
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will find out what time the special arrives at Paddington,
and will meet him. The difficulty to my mind
is how we can expose Gaunt’s share in the Amanti
business without giving Weiss away,” Sherren remarked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“You may safely leave that in my hands. By the
bye, are you in touch with the directors of the Amanti
Mining Company?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The chairman is a personal friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Excellent. And do you think that you could persuade
this friend to do what you asked?” the Baron asked
significantly.</p>

<p>“Yes. But it might prove rather costly, but of course
it would depend upon the nature of the service,” Sherren
replied promptly.</p>

<p>“We will talk of it later on, for there is no immediate
hurry. In the meantime you must keep up your attack
on Gaunt. Don’t miss a single opportunity, for at all
costs we must damage his reputation. It would seem
that he is now working hand in hand with the secretary
of the Congo Reform Association, and they are evidently
planning out a campaign on a grand scale. I fear that
this man Gaunt is rapidly capturing the sympathy of the
public, and it is essential that we expose him so that anything
he says will be discredited. I trust you to do your
best, and your reward shall be commensurate with your
success. Succeed in crushing Gaunt, and your future is
assured,” the Baron said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I will do all I can, Baron, but I must own to a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
amount of admiration for Gaunt’s pluck. He must know
that he is risking a good deal, and yet he does not seem
to hesitate. There is no mistaking from this new mood
that he means business, for those advertisements must
have cost a tidy penny. Besides——”</p>

<p>“I shall expect you here at three o’clock with Weiss,”
the Baron interrupted him sharply, for he was not in the
humor to listen to platitudes.</p>

<p>Sherren accepted his dismissal meekly, for he was not
the man to resent outwardly a direct insult, so long as he
was to receive a financial reward that was sufficiently
great, but to himself he cursed the Baron with vigor.</p>

<p>De Croiseuil lighted a cigarette with great care, and
sat down to think out his next move, and finally decided
to call upon Gaunt, although he knew that it was very
probable that he would be refused admittance. Indeed,
the footman did hesitate, but finally asked him to take
a seat in the hall.</p>

<p>“It will be unfortunate if madame comes along,” the
Baron thought as he waited.</p>

<p>It was some few minutes before the footman returned,
and he became sure that his expectations would be
realized, but to his great surprise he was asked to go to
the library.</p>

<p>Gaunt was standing in the middle of the room facing
the door, and his expression was cold and forbidding.</p>

<p>“If I had refused to see you, you might have imagined
that I was afraid. I do not think that there is anything
to be gained by this interview, and I shall be glad if you
will state your errand in as few words as possible,” Gaunt
said grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>The Baron smiled, and his eyes moved around the
room in search of a chair.</p>

<p>“You are not very polite, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>. But even if we
are to be enemies you will not deny me the ease of a
seat. I am no longer a young man, and—ah—thank
you, Gaunt. I know you will not mind if I smoke a
cigarette. I can talk so much better, and this morning I
wish to be very eloquent.”</p>

<p>“I have never known you, Baron, when you could not
talk, and that time will only arrive when you are in your
grave,” Gaunt said drily.</p>

<p>“A truce to compliments. We know one another—our
faults and our virtues, and so we will come to business.
Of what extraordinary extravagances you have
been guilty. These advertisements must have cost you a
small fortune, and for what purpose, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cher</i>? You
throw your money away and the return you will receive
is what—ruin. I have not come here to threaten, but
merely to state my intentions. If you persist in this
mad course it will be my painful duty to act at once.
Every dishonorable deed in your life shall be made public
and there is a ghastly array to your discredit. Not
only will there be those things in the Congo of which I
have already reminded you, but there are many little
affairs of England—many little deals by which you have
enriched yourself that will not bear the light of day. It
will pain me to make these exposures, but you yourself
will be the first to see that they are necessary. It is my
painful duty to discredit you to the world, and I shall
succeed,” the Baron wound up with quiet confidence.</p>

<p>“You appear to forget one thing, Baron. If I cease
to speak, there are others who can take my place. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
may ruin my character, but that will not smother the cry
for reform. You say that we know one another, but I
think you are wilfully blind to my character. I have
vowed to fight you until the natives are free, and receive
equitable treatment, and nothing shall turn me back, now
I have once started. You can do your worst,” Gaunt
cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>“And that is your final word?” the Baron said with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes. It will be well if you do not call here again
for——”</p>

<p>“There is no need to finish the sentence. Let us, at
least, retain the appearance of politeness. You English
are so brutal in your enmities. Although I am about to
injure you seriously, I like you personally, Gaunt, and
apart from this sordid business, I shall always be glad to
meet you. So you have decided. I am very sorry, my
friend, for I am afraid that Lady Mildred will——”</p>

<p>“Be silent, and go,” Gaunt cried harshly.</p>

<p>“I hate to war upon a lady, for she will suffer with
you, and——”</p>

<p>“Go.”</p>

<p>There was a threat in Gaunt’s voice, and the Baron
perceptibly hastened his step, and his nether lip trembled
slightly. The footman threw open the door, and he
hastened to cross the hall, but when he reached the
pavement he stood there for a few moments. Then he
strode slowly towards Piccadilly but had not gone very
far before he heard his name called from behind.</p>

<p>He turned quickly and uncovered his head.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, and bowed politely to the beautiful
girl who had joined him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“I am Lady Ethel Blythe.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I knew your sister, but in those days I think
you must have been at school,” he said pleasantly, and
there was unconcealed admiration in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you not come into the park? I wish to speak to
you,” Lady Ethel remarked, nervously.</p>

<p>She had acted on the impulse of the moment, and was
already beginning to regret the step that she had taken,
but the Baron was only too glad of the chance of gaining
information, and so promptly led the way across the
road, keeping up a steady flow of conversation until they
reached a row of chairs.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down, Lady Ethel? I do not think it
is too cold, for your furs will keep you warm,” he said
suavely, and again she encountered the look of admiration
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why have you quarrelled with Mr. Gaunt?” she demanded
suddenly.</p>

<p>It was with the idea of helping her sister that she had
intercepted the Baron, and already she realized that she
would receive no consideration from this man whom instinct
told her to distrust. Suddenly she grew afraid,
and continued hurriedly: “I think I have made a mistake,
Baron, and will go. Forgive me for having detained
you.”</p>

<p>“Stay, Lady Ethel. Please let us have a little talk, for
I am sure that you may be the means of stopping Mr.
Gaunt from ruining himself; that is, if you have any influence
with your sister. My position is a particularly
unfortunate one, for I was once a friend of your family,
and Gaunt is compelling me to become his enemy.”</p>

<p>“What is all this wretched bother about? What is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Mr. Gaunt attacking the Congo for?” she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“If you could find out the answer to that last question,
I should be eternally your debtor. Cannot you and
I become allies? I give you my word of honor that I
am anxious to be Gaunt’s friend, if only he will permit
me to be. Of course, I can understand that your sister
must feel bitterly the insane course which her husband is
taking?” he suggested, and she did not notice the eager
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“She naturally resents it, and is very unhappy,” was
her impulsive answer.</p>

<p>“I can readily understand that, and in my opinion she
is quite justified in resenting it. But I do hope that they
have not already seriously quarreled.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him suspiciously for she could detect a
note of insincerity in his voice.</p>

<p>“I have no right to discuss my sister’s affairs,” she
said coldly.</p>

<p>However, the Baron had already obtained the information
that he sought, but took good care that Lady
Ethel should not see his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“May I ask you to use your influence both with your
sister and with Gaunt to persuade the latter to abandon
this wretched agitation? I am sure you will do so when
I say that he is likely to suffer both in pocket and reputation,
if he does not do so. I won’t detain you any
longer, Lady Ethel, but if at any time you should wish
to communicate with me, I am staying at the Ritz.”</p>

<p>Lady Ethel was eager to get away, but her face grew
white, for approaching her rapidly was Edward Drake.
The Baron, too, saw him, and smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Lady Ethel, I shall be glad to take you home. You
must know that both your sister and Mr. Gaunt have
given orders that this gentleman is not to be allowed to
enter their house again,” Drake said coldly, and stared
at the Belgian, his eyes full of hostility.</p>

<p>“Then I have the honor of wishing you good-day.”</p>

<p>And so saying the Baron raised his hat and strolled
away.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel was silent as they walked along, and
Drake could not decide if she were angry with him or
herself, but he came to the conclusion that she needed a
lesson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Baron was quite pleased at his encounter
with Lady Ethel, for it was well to know that
Gaunt and his wife were not on good terms, and
it ought not to be a difficult matter to widen the breach.
Upon arriving at the hotel several telegrams were
handed to him, and a frown came to his face as he read
the cipher message from Brussels which urged him to
stop Gaunt’s campaign at all costs. But still he did not
allow it to interfere with his enjoyment of a carefully
selected lunch. The Burgundy was warmed to the exact
temperature which suited his palate, and when the coffee
was served he felt quite equal to the coming interview
with Mr. Julian Weiss. He was dozing in an armchair
before the fire when his visitor was announced, and he
rose to greet the Jew with that suave pleasant manner
for which he was famed.</p>

<p>“I am indeed pleased to see you. Of course you will
smoke, and I can confidently recommend those Corona-Coronas.”</p>

<p>The Baron himself did not care for cigars, but he was an
excellent judge of them, and knew their value as a gift to
one whom he wished to place on good terms with himself.</p>

<p>“Sherren came to me and said that you wished to see
me on most important business. As you know, I am always
prepared to consider a scheme in which I can see a
reasonable profit,” Weiss said, in his rather pompous
manner, and then took a long draw at the cigar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“It may disappoint you to hear that there is no
money to be made out of our little talk.”</p>

<p>“My time is valuable, Baron, and if I had
known——”</p>

<p>“But I think that there are other things that appeal to
you as well as money. You are not the man to forget a
bad turn, and I understand that Gaunt rather bested you
in a recent deal.”</p>

<p>“Bested—he swindled me,” Weiss cried hotly.</p>

<p>The Baron smiled faintly, as he heard the Jew’s betrayal
of his nationality, for in his anger the careful pronunciation
had been forgotten.</p>

<p>“If your business concerns Gaunt, and there is a
chance of getting level with him, then I am with you,
money or no money.”</p>

<p>“I imagined that would be your attitude. You say
that Gaunt swindled you, and I’ve the same complaint to
make against him. Only, in my case, he has betrayed
those who were his friends, and who had helped him to
his wealth. Now, I want you to tell me the whole of
the circumstances of that deal in Amanti shares,” the
Baron said quickly.</p>

<p>There was a quick glance from Weiss that was full of
suspicion.</p>

<p>“Of course, anything that you say I shall hold in the
strictest confidence, and I shall take no step without
consulting you,” the Baron added quickly.</p>

<p>“All right, Baron. I know that you aren’t over particular
yourself, and you won’t be shocked at a little sharp
practice,” Weiss said with a laugh, that grated on the
Belgian’s nerves.</p>

<p>“I got hold of a man named Davis, and it was arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
that he should cable home a report in his manager’s
name to the effect that they had struck gold of a high
grade. I didn’t want my name to appear in the business,
so I agreed with Gaunt to work the market. It came
off, and Gaunt made his pile, but when I went to claim
my share he practically told me to go to the devil,” Weiss
wound up angrily, for he still smarted to think of the
way he had been “done.”</p>

<p>“And to add insult to injury,” he continued, “the
blackguard sent a check in my name to the King’s
Hospital Fund for the amount I ought to have received.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea why he did that? It was very
strange, for it could not have been on account of the
money that he refused to pay you,” the Baron remarked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a damn about his reasons. I want my
twenty odd thousand pounds, and I’ll have it, or Gaunt
shall pay me in some other way,” the Jew cried furiously,
and jumping to his feet commenced to pace rapidly to
and fro.</p>

<p>“I can see that you are going for him in the papers,
and I’ll give you as much information as you can want
about various shady deals in which he has been concerned.
And I’ll give you the evidence to prove ’em up to the
hilt. I schwear I’ll make the city too hot for Mr. John
Gaunt before I’ve done with him.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it turn out that there really was a valuable
find of gold?”</p>

<p>“So they reported, but I have just heard that the report
was incorrect, although the manager out there evidently
believed in it. When I left the office Amantis
were selling at five shillings with no buyers. I bought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
myself when they were at two pounds, and so I got left
again,” Weiss said savagely.</p>

<p>“Very unfortunate. I do not wonder that you were
angry. By the bye, have you any evidence that Gaunt
had knowledge that the cable sent by Davis was forged?”
the Baron asked casually.</p>

<p>“Yes. Read through this letter.”</p>

<p>De Croiseuil rapidly scanned the few lines but his face
gave no sign of the satisfaction that he felt.</p>

<p>“That seems quite clear. I wonder if you would mind
if I kept this letter?” He placed it carefully in his
pocketbook without waiting for an answer, and then
continued more quietly.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if you will send me details of any
other shady transactions by Gaunt, and I will see that
they are made use of at once. Now I think we have finished,
and I expect you will be glad to get back to the City.
Take another cigar.”</p>

<p>“You will not allow my name to appear?” Weiss said
uneasily.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, I am a gentleman, and—but you can
trust me. Good-day, and thanks.”</p>

<p>When Weiss had gone the Baron sent out for the
evening papers, and once more settled himself in comfort
before the fire, but as he read a frown came to his face,
and he uttered an imprecation.</p>

<p>The same advertisement again stared him in the face,
and it was natural that the public should take an interest
in the spending of such large sums of money, even if the
wrongs of the natives of the Congo failed to interest the
“man in the street.” Moreover, it was becoming realized
that Gaunt was deeply in earnest and had deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
started to fight the powerful clique in Brussels. The
millionaire’s well-known character naturally increased the
interest, and there could be no doubt that the agitation
would soon extend so that its suppression would become
an increasingly difficult task.</p>

<p>In great staring letters there was an announcement
that Gaunt was to address a men’s meeting at the Royal
Albert Hall.</p>

<p>“And the man will fill the building,” the Baron muttered
uneasily.</p>

<p>It was no small thing for which he was fighting. It
must be remembered that he and his friends received a
large income, which would cease immediately, should the
reform be forced upon them. Just as soon as the natives
were given justice, the rubber would cease to come, at
any rate until the country had had time to recover itself
from years of merciless persecution. There were thousands
of Belgians whose livelihood depended upon the
continuation of the present régime, and in the event of
its ceasing, Belgium would swarm with those men, most
of them undesirables whose morals were utterly ruined
by the lives they had led in the Congo.</p>

<p>And they had been going along so smoothly until the
intervention of Gaunt. The death of King Leopold had
promised to give them an indefinite prolongation of their
reign, for his successor was a man of amiable character,
who lived a clean life, and they could shelter themselves
beneath his name. The great desire of Europe would be
to give King Albert an opportunity of showing what he
could do, for it was not realized that he possessed but
titular power. The late King had been an absolute
monarch, and his conduct had almost driven the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
to seek a Republic; so that it was necessary for King
Albert to tread warily, and become the most constitutional
of sovereigns.</p>

<p>Of the Belgian Parliament the Baron had no fear; there
was no party that desired to see reform in the Congo
save a few members who really understood the conditions
of affairs in the Free State.</p>

<p>For years King Leopold had understood that the only
possible means by which he could be stopped from
garnering his tainted gold was by the awakening of
England and the United States to the truth. He had
recognized that these free people were sound at heart,
loathing all persecution, and that should they once realize
the brutal truth, their righteous indignation would
insist upon the immediate freeing of the natives from a
diabolical tyranny.</p>

<p>And now the danger of a great awakening loomed
ahead.</p>

<p>The mask fell from the Baron’s face, as these thoughts
passed through his mind, and there was a malignant
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I will break the man,” he muttered vindictively.</p>

<p>Gone was the suave man of the world and the brutal
savage was revealed. But at the sound of a knock at
the door, his face changed and a smile was forced to his
lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Sherren. What news have you?” he
asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I met Davis at Paddington, and I’ve got his address.”</p>

<p>“Good. Here’s a little document that you might like
to read,” the Baron remarked and handed over the letter
given to him by Weiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Sherren looked at him admiringly, when he had mastered
its contents.</p>

<p>“I wonder that Weiss cared to part with it, but I suppose
that he was blinded by his rage against Gaunt.
This little document simplifies matters, and ought to be
very useful.”</p>

<p>“Weiss is sending on further material against Gaunt,
and I shall be glad if you will sift it thoroughly, for it’s
important that we don’t make any mistakes.”</p>

<p>The Baron turned to the waiter who had entered, and
took a telegram from the silver salver, which he tore
open impatiently:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“<em>Am forwarding Marillier documents. Advise</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>that you proceed without delay.</em>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There is no answer,” he said, and then lapsed into
silence, for the message gave him food for thought.</p>

<p>Sherren was glancing through the evening papers, and
now and then stopped to make a note, which he intended
to use in an article which he was preparing for the next
day.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien.</i> I think we have finished for the present,
Sherren. I would suggest that you see your friend, the
chairman of the Amanti Mining Company, and show him
that letter. You know what to advise him to do,” the
Baron said significantly.</p>

<p>“But what about Weiss? His name is compromised,
and——”</p>

<p>“I fear that this is not the moment for delicate
scruples. Of course, I should like to protect Mr. Weiss
in every way that is possible, but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders expressively.</p>

<p>“But if Weiss must suffer with Gaunt, it is unfortunate;
but I shouldn’t consider the chief rabbi himself if
it would interfere with my attack on Gaunt. I shall
await your report with much interest. Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>And the Baron took from a silver box on the table a
cigarette which he carefully lighted. Then he drew a
deep breath.</p>

<p>“Now I think we are coming to close quarters, and
we shall see a pretty fight—but——”</p>

<p>The Baron’s face became moody.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> John Gaunt had deliberately planned to fan his
wife’s dawning love into a fierce flame, he could
not have acted in a manner more calculated to
bring this about, for when Lady Mildred saw that he was
deliberately avoiding every opportunity of intimate conversation,
she became utterly miserable, although she
had led him to believe that this was what she herself
desired.</p>

<p>It was strange to her, this feeling of interest in her
husband, and all day she found herself wondering what
he was doing. At first she did not regret the attitude
which she had taken up, but slowly it was being revealed
to her that all other considerations were as nought
when compared with love. With this realization there
came a feeling of timidity which restrained her impulse
to go to Gaunt and tell him what was in her heart.</p>

<p>What mattered his actions, however strange—what
mattered his damaged reputation, so long as he loved her
with the deep passion of which she had been permitted
to catch a faint glimpse. She would force herself to forget
the many mysterious things which surrounded her,
and would only remember that he was her husband, and
father of the child that she was rapidly growing to
worship.</p>

<p>Of one thing she was convinced, that there was nothing
mean in Gaunt’s nature. If he had been guilty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
conduct which he was endeavoring to hide, and which
was preying on his mind, it was nothing of which he
need feel ashamed; and thus it will be seen that Lady
Mildred did not yet understand the nature of the man
that she had married.</p>

<p>On the morning that the Baron had paid his second
visit, she had been communing with herself, and had decided
to put an end to the estrangement that existed,
but when she went down to lunch, her husband was not
there.</p>

<p>Her sister and Edward Drake were present, and it
very soon became clear to her that the atmosphere was
electrical, for each of them avoided addressing any remark
to the other.</p>

<p>Drake confined his attention to Lady Mildred, and the
latter immediately began to imagine that he had proposed
marriage to Lady Ethel, and had been refused.</p>

<p>At last the uncomfortable meal came to an end, and
Lady Mildred rose from the table.</p>

<p>“Will you come to my room, dear?” she said, and
Lady Ethel followed her obediently.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” Lady Mildred asked when
they were seated.</p>

<p>“I hate him, he is a beast,” Lady Ethel said vindictively.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean Mr. Drake. What has the poor
man done?”</p>

<p>“He has been very rude, and I believe he looks upon
me as a child,” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>“You are not much more than a child, Ethel. But
what is it all about?” Lady Mildred asked with an
indulgent smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“I really did it for the best. When the Baron left
this morning I followed, and went with him to the
park.”</p>

<p>“It was a stupid thing to do. Baron de Croiseuil is
not a desirable acquaintance,” Lady Mildred answered
disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“I only went for your sake, Mildred. I could see that
you and John were miserable, and I guessed that it was
all owing to the Baron, so thought I might help.”</p>

<p>Lady Ethel was crying quietly, so her sister suppressed
the angry words that were near her lips, and
kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>“There is no reason why you should make such a fuss
about it,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“I never imagined that Mr. Drake could be so rude.
He told me that I was a meddlesome little busybody,”
Lady Ethel said hotly.</p>

<p>“They were rather strong words.”</p>

<p>“And I really didn’t mean to tell the Baron that you
and John had quarreled; it slipped out.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake was quite right,” Lady Mildred broke in
vehemently. “Besides, it is untrue that my husband
and I have quarreled. I love him dearly.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have a funny way of showing your
affection,” Lady Ethel broke in, and then began to sob
in earnest.</p>

<p>Even at school she had been thoroughly spoilt, for her
winning ways had endeared her to all, and Drake’s
strong words had come as a shock. Now her sister was
adding to her misery, but she quickly recovered herself
and sailed out of the room with rather a pitiable attempt
at dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Lady Mildred was annoyed at the occurrence, but she
had more weighty thoughts to occupy her mind, and
could only wonder how John would receive the advances
which she had determined to make. To her great
disappointment he did not return, and so soon after six
o’clock she commenced to dress for dinner. Latterly
she had taken but little interest in her toilet, and her
maid was surprised and pleased by the care she took in
choosing her gown. At last she was satisfied, and
critically examined her reflection in the long mirror.
The least vain of women, she knew that she was
looking her best, and when she entered the drawing-room,
excitement had brought a becoming touch of
color to her cheeks.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes before Gaunt entered, and gave a
quick glance around the room.</p>

<p>“I haven’t much time to spare,” he said hurriedly, and
as he spoke dinner was announced.</p>

<p>During the meal Lady Ethel was particularly
gracious to Captain Drake, and practically ignored his
brother.</p>

<p>“Drake, we must be going,” Gaunt said after a glance
at his watch.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred also rose and accompanied them to the
hall.</p>

<p>“Will you be very late, John?” she said nervously.</p>

<p>“No. I shall be back as soon as the meeting is
over,” he answered, and could not keep a note of surprise
from his voice.</p>

<p>“Then will you come to my room?” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Very well, dear,” he answered, and gave her a quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
look, but her face was turned away, and he uttered a
faint sigh which failed to reach her ears.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel had followed more slowly, and she did not
appear to notice Edward Drake who was standing near.</p>

<p>“I hope you have recovered,” he remarked with a
smile. “Perhaps I was a little hard, but you really
deserved all that I said. I can see that you are still
angry with me, but if you take a night to think it over,
you will arrive at the conclusion that I was right.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware that Mr. Gaunt had appointed you
father confessor to the whole family. Mr. Drake, you
really take too much upon yourself,” she said haughtily.</p>

<p>“Come along,” Gaunt cried impatiently.</p>

<p>For a time Lady Ethel sat with her sister, but she was
ill at ease, and at an early hour expressed her intention
of going to bed. Lady Mildred was relieved by her
departure, for she wished to be alone with her thoughts.</p>

<p>A clock chimed ten o’clock, and she went to her bedroom,
where she summoned her maid and clothed herself
in a dressing-gown covered with clouds of filmy lace
that was priceless. Every jewel was removed except her
wedding-ring, and at last she was satisfied with her
appearance.</p>

<p>“If it were my last mistress, I should say that my
lady was about to receive her lover,” was the maid’s
unspoken thought.</p>

<p>“May I say that my lady is very beautiful to-night?”
the maid remarked respectfully, and she regarded her
mistress with the eye of an expert.</p>

<p>It was the first time that she had dared venture upon
a compliment, and she half expected a rebuke as a
reward, but Lady Mildred only smiled faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“There are some deep red roses, my lady. At your
breast they would give the one finishing touch that
makes perfect. May I fetch them?” the maid asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Am I a simple little fool?” Lady Mildred asked
herself when she once again entered the room to which
she had invited her husband.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly, and once or twice she took up a
book only to throw it down again with a sigh of impatience.
Eleven o’clock struck, and she began to
wonder if he would fail to come.</p>

<p>But at last there was a knock at the door, and in
answer to her call John Gaunt strode into the room.
His face was drawn and he had the appearance of a man
who was exhausted physically and mentally. But his
eyes lighted up with admiration and passionate love
when they rested on his wife.</p>

<p>“Sit down, dear,” she said nervously. “You look
very tired. Did you have a successful meeting?”</p>

<p>As she spoke she took up a cushion, and placed it beneath
his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t often wait on you, John,” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>He could not keep the wonder from his face, for never
had she been so gentle, and so entirely fascinating. But
he remembered his determination, and kept a tight hold
upon himself.</p>

<p>Then she sank down on the rug beside him and rested
her elbows on his knees. At first her eyes were cast
down, but suddenly she raised them and looked straight
at him.</p>

<p>“Mildred,” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“John, dear, let me tell you what is in my heart,”
she began tremulously. “I don’t think that I am the
same woman that you married, for I feel——Forgive
me if I say a lot about myself, for that is the only way
in which I can make you understand. When we married,
I did not care for you, I’m not sure if I even liked
you, for at times you made me afraid. However, I was
watching you and learning. But I was blind and selfish
until baby came, and it was not till then that I began to
understand something of what life can contain.”</p>

<p>John Gaunt scarcely dared to breathe as he listened.
He knew how deeply she must be moved to reveal herself
so openly to him.</p>

<p>“Since baby came it has been a gradual awakening.
Even when I asked you to take me away on the yacht,
I did not fully understand. I only knew that my feelings
towards you had changed, and that you occupied
my thoughts almost entirely.”</p>

<p>As she continued her voice took a deeper tone, and
her eyes were not removed from his, so that he could see
their changing expression and gathering passion.</p>

<p>“And then you refused to go away with me, and I
was deeply hurt, for I naturally thought that you did not
want me. I even feared that I had lost your love, and
it was agony—agony.”</p>

<p>He could feel the trembling of her arms, and he longed
to clasp her to him. But dare he do so, with his past
unconfessed? He had decided that he would not again
seek her love until he could go to her with clean hands,
and yet———</p>

<p>“But soon it was revealed to me that the world was
nothing. If you have sinned in the past, if you fear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
people will make charges against you, that could not affect
you and me, John.” Her voice was tremulous, and
there was a wild appeal in her eyes.</p>

<p>“John, it is difficult to say the words, but I love you,
body and soul, even as I believe that you love me.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and looked down at him with an
air of pride in this declaration of her love.</p>

<p>“All petty considerations have vanished. I make no
conditions. I ask no favor of you, save that you shall
love me.”</p>

<p>He remained silent, and a great fear clutched at her
heart.</p>

<p>“John,” she whispered faintly.</p>

<p>With a cry of passion he took her in his arms and
crushed her to him.</p>

<p>“Mildred.”</p>

<p>And her lips sought his, for the first kiss of acknowledged
love.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Earl of Lynton was not in the best of tempers
as he entered the boat train at Dover, on
his way to London. An attaché to the British
embassy in Paris, he had received peremptory instructions
by cable from Sir Keith Hamilton, the secretary of state
for foreign affairs, to proceed to London and report himself
at the foreign office, immediately upon his arrival.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should be curious as to the reason
why his presence should be so urgently required.
Had it been a couple of years ago he would have imagined
that his many creditors had been making themselves
objectionable to the authorities, but his sister Mildred’s
marriage to John Gaunt had, once for all, removed
that sort of worry from his life.</p>

<p>The Earl was a very ordinary sort of man of average
intelligence, but with a keen capacity for the enjoyment
of life. To do him justice he had been reluctant that his
sister should marry Gaunt, and, in spite of the great pecuniary
advantages attached to the match, he had not
said a word to influence her decision.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the marriage, he had received
his appointment to Paris, and since then had paid
very few visits to England. Neither Lady Mildred nor
himself were good correspondents, but he had gathered
the impression that she was quite content with her lot.</p>

<p>During the last few days he had noticed reports in the
French papers connecting Gaunt with the Congo agitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
but it was not until the journey to London that he
realized there was anything serious in the matter.</p>

<p>It chanced that there was a lack of interesting news at
the moment and editors had seized upon John Gaunt to
make the sensation of the hour. The <cite>Daily Comet</cite> had
started its special commissioner to work, and that gifted
penman could raise a storm where all was peace, and he
was accordingly paid the salary of a cabinet minister.</p>

<p>Now Lord Lynton’s one failing was an overweening
pride in his name, and he felt hurt that Gaunt’s action
should have brought about those disgraceful comments
which would naturally reflect upon his sister, for the
<cite>Comet</cite> was suggesting that his brother-in-law was a most
undesirable person; and so the Earl was determined that
the Congo crusade must come to an end.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he knew but little of Gaunt’s character,
for they had met on very few occasions, and each
time there had been a little natural embarrassment on his
part, for his future brother-in-law had quietly insisted on
paying his debts, and settling upon him and his heirs a
sum of money which had made him comfortably well off,
if not rich. Lord Lynton had demurred to accepting
these favors, even at the hands of a future relative, but
Gaunt had taken no notice of his protests and had merely
given instructions to the family solicitors, and the Earl
had found that his debts had been paid and the settlement
executed. After all Lady Mildred was making a sacrifice
in marrying a mere financier, and it was very comforting
to think that the worry of a heavy load of debt
had been removed from her mind.</p>

<p>At Victoria Station Lord Lynton jumped into a taxi-cab,
and drove straight to the foreign office, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
he was received almost immediately by Sir Keith
Hamilton.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have brought you from your arduous
duties so abruptly,” the foreign secretary remarked by
way of greeting, and there was a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>Sir Keith had the reputation of being a strong minister,
and perhaps it was owing to the fact that he knew
when to remain silent. His speeches in the House were
of admirable terseness, and he had made a point of steering
as clear as possible of party conflicts, so that he enjoyed
the respect and confidence of each side of the
House. It was rarely that any rash member tried to
cross swords with him, for he possessed a biting wit that
was used unsparingly, greatly to the discomfiture of his
adversaries.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton smiled but made no answer to the
remark.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact I want you here only because
you are the brother-in-law of John Gaunt. I suppose
that in the moments that you can spare from society you
do sometimes study international politics, and you are
probably aware that there is room for improvement in the
present position. I am referring more particularly to
Germany, but I don’t blame them more than ourselves.
If war ever takes place between us, it will have been
brought about by the press. The position is such that
we have to avoid every possibility of disagreement, and
your worthy brother-in-law is embarrassing me considerably.
The Congo must be a great question in the future,
and I am anxious to delay the day as much as possible.
The Free State is surrounded by colonies owned by
England, France, and Germany, and each country would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
like the largest slice when the division takes place. Unfortunately
Germany is absurdly jealous of England, and
we reciprocate the feeling just as absurdly. Therefore
they will look upon any step we may take with the greatest
suspicion, and we should return the compliment. Do
you follow me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” Lord Lynton answered quietly.</p>

<p>“Good. This being the state of affairs, it is essential
that the Congo question should be kept out of sight as
much as possible. Your brother-in-law evidently does
not understand this, for he is responsible for an agitation
which is rapidly becoming a nuisance. I think you will
now understand what I want. Gaunt must be silenced,
and it struck me that you, being a relative, were the most
desirable person to bring this about.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have any influence with Mr.
Gaunt. True, he is my brother-in-law, but we have
seen very little of one another,” the Earl said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Then you must cultivate his acquaintance. Probably
you have some influence with your sister. You may be
able to reach Gaunt through her. I want you to appreciate
that the matter is very serious, and that you must
leave no stone unturned to make him keep his mouth
shut. If once the British public gets the bit between its
teeth, there is no holding it, and we shall be forced to intervene.”</p>

<p>“I see the danger, and I will do my best, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. If he is obstinate, send him to see me at once.
Let me know how you get on as I am rather anxious.
You need not hurry to get back to your post.”</p>

<p>And the secretary gave him a curt nod of dismissal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Lord Lynton did not at all like the task that had been
given to him, but there was no alternative save to obey,
so he ordered his baggage to be put on a taxi-cab, and
as he was about to step in, a newsboy thrust a paper into
his hands.</p>

<p>“<em>Evenin’ Comet</em>, sir? All the news.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton gave the boy a copper, and during the
drive casually glanced at the paper, but suddenly an exclamation
escaped him, and he proceeded to read a half
column with the deepest attention.</p>

<p>“I think that it was about time I came home,” he muttered
savagely. And when he entered Gaunt’s house
there was a grim look on his face.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he waited in the hall until a glad
cry was heard, and Lady Ethel ran towards him with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>“How glad I am to see you, Geoffrey,” she cried, and
gave him an affectionate embrace.</p>

<p>“Where is Mildred?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“With her husband. Come along to them,” she said,
and slipping her arm through his, drew him along.</p>

<p>Gaunt and his wife were sitting close together, and it
was evident to Lord Lynton that they were on the best
of terms. Lady Mildred’s expression was that of a perfectly
happy woman, and he thought how greatly she had
improved. Her greeting was a quiet one, and then
Gaunt came towards him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Run away, girls; I want to have a business talk with
Gaunt, and afterwards I shall be at your service,” Lord
Lynton said hurriedly, as he just touched his brother-in-law’s
hand.</p>

<p>“My husband has no secrets from me—isn’t that so?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Lady Mildred said quietly, turning to Gaunt with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Do you wish her to remain?” the Earl asked coldly.</p>

<p>“It is as my wife wishes,” Gaunt answered, and frankly
met his brother-in-law’s rather hostile look.</p>

<p>“You had better go, Ethel. I don’t suppose we shall
be very long.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is that wretched Congo again,” Lady
Ethel said petulantly, but she left the room.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Gaunt asked quietly, exchanging
glances with his wife who had drawn closer and had
slipped her hand into his.</p>

<p>“I really came to see you about this Congo foolishness,
but there is something in to-night’s paper that is of
more consequence. Please read this paragraph, and you
will understand why I am rather upset.”</p>

<p>Gaunt took the paper, and his lips were firmly pressed
together when he saw the head-lines.</p>

<p>“<em>A deal in Amanti Shares. Curious story at the
Police Court.</em>”</p>

<p>He rapidly mastered the statement which followed—the
arrest of Davis at the instance of the Mining Company
for having forged and despatched the cable, and the
explicit statement that Julian Weiss and John Gaunt
were the men who had planned the forgery. In counsel’s
short speech the facts were disclosed, and Gaunt realized
that it was impossible to deny their accuracy.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, he handed the paper to Lady
Mildred, and his eyes were fixed anxiously on her face
as she read.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” she said at last.</p>

<p>“It is simple. If this account is true, your husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
conspired with the Jewish financier, Weiss, to commit a
gross fraud upon the public. Is that correct?” Lord
Lynton demanded of Gaunt.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is quite right,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>“And do you deny the charge that they make against
you?”</p>

<p>“I do not recognize your right to question me,” Gaunt
answered coldly, but he was eagerly looking down at his
wife, and her hand still rested in his.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better tell you the whole story,” he
began, addressing himself to Lady Mildred.</p>

<p>The facts were soon told, and he suppressed nothing
except the vow that he had made, but when he spoke of
the interview at which Edward Drake had been present,
and the subsequent sending of the check to the King’s
Hospital Fund, the look of distress vanished from his
wife’s face.</p>

<p>“You did not benefit from it, John. Of course you
were very wrong in the first place, but——”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you look at it, Mildred? Then you
have indeed changed,” Lord Lynton cried harshly.
“Cannot you understand that Gaunt has been found out
in a dishonorable act? By this time all London will
have read the report of the proceedings at the police
court, and they will rightly call him a——”</p>

<p>“Silence, Geoffrey!” she cried peremptorily, and her
bosom rose and fell quickly. “Perhaps John may have
done wrong, and I am sorry, but I do not intend to allow
it to affect me. If you wish to remain friends you must
be silent.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton gazed at his sister in wonder.</p>

<p>“Of course, Gaunt may be able to smooth the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
over. It would be advisable to go to the Amanti people
at once, and if necessary, pay them handsomely for withdrawing
the charge. Then you can get a clever counsel
to go to the police court, and say that it is all a mistake.
It is only a question of money,” he said with the
idea of making the best of the situation.</p>

<p>“I intend to take no step at all, for I cannot deny its
truth,” Gaunt answered, and he felt his wife’s hand tremble
slightly.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton uttered an exclamation of anger, but
quickly brought into play his diplomatic training.</p>

<p>“We will discuss it later on—with other matters,” he
remarked, and Lady Mildred gave a quick sigh of relief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lady Mildred</span> was dressed for dinner, and as
it was rather early, she sat down in her own
room, but very soon Gaunt came in. They had
not spoken since the interview with her brother, and
there were still traces of anxiety on his face.</p>

<p>“You were very good to stand up for me in the way
you did, Mildred,” he said earnestly. “Your brother
was in the right, for it is a sordid business, and I greatly
regret it.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, John,” she said gently, and drawing
his face to hers, kissed him on the lips. “Perhaps it is
true that women lose some of their ideas of morality
when they love, for I cannot condemn you. I only know
that I love you.”</p>

<p>He took her in his arms, and there was a great yearning
in his eyes, as he looked steadfastly at her.</p>

<p>“These last few hours have given me a glimpse of
paradise, dearest. For your sake, I wish that I had been
a better man. If I had met you years ago, I believe that
I should have always been straight. At any rate, I can
give you my word that there shall be nothing in my
future to make you ashamed.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of that, John. Promise me that you will
be very patient with Geoffrey. He is impulsive and may
say things that will hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I will keep my temper for your sake. After all he
has some reason on his side, for this scandal will naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
reflect upon you, and indirectly upon himself. Now I
think it is time to go down to dinner.”</p>

<p>“One kiss, dearest.”</p>

<p>And she placed her arms around his neck and drew
him to her. And John was happy, in spite of the many
dangers by which he was surrounded. There was only
one thing that he feared—that she should become acquainted
with the Marillier affair. Her present attitude
assured him that she would forgive the exposure of any
of the shady transactions in the City of which he had
been guilty, but he realized that a charge of murder was a
very different matter.</p>

<p>At dinner Lord Lynton made himself agreeable, and
the conversation became animated, all taking part in it
save John Gaunt, for he suspected the reason of his
brother-in-law’s unexpected journey from Paris, and he
anticipated an unpleasant interview. However, it was
not his way to postpone anything that was disagreeable,
so when the ladies had left the room, he proposed that
the Earl should accompany him to the library.</p>

<p>“I do not intend to talk about that Amanti business.
I will be quite frank with you, Gaunt. I was sent for by
the foreign secretary, and he wishes me to tell you that
your present action of fanning this Congo agitation is
causing him serious embarrassment,” Lord Lynton said
slowly and impressively.</p>

<p>“I can quite understand that he does not like it,”
Gaunt answered with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“The present moment is inopportune for the raising
of any international question. It is impossible for us to
do anything without Germany, and she thinks us incapable
of any action for philanthropic motives. She imagines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
that we have an eye on the Congo Free State,
and that if any partition should take place we shall, as
usual, succeed in getting the lion’s share.”</p>

<p>“I do not think that we should allow Germany to dictate
our policy. In other days England was wont to go
her own way, and she was always eager to help the oppressed.”</p>

<p>“We have already done everything in our power, for
we have made urgent representations to the Belgian
government.”</p>

<p>“Representations are useless—a cruiser at the mouth
of the Congo is the only effective argument,” Gaunt answered
drily.</p>

<p>“You will not try to understand our difficulties, and it
is useless discussing the matter further. I want you to
promise that you will do your utmost to stop this agitation.
I presume that it is you that pay for these advertisements.
May I ask why you are wasting your money
in this way?”</p>

<p>“Surely that is my business. If I like to throw away
my own money, it only concerns myself. On occasions
I have given away large amounts, when there was no
prospect of an adequate return.”</p>

<p>The Earl’s face flushed, and he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I suppose you intend to refer to myself. You were
very generous, and the money came when I was hard
pressed. I am very grateful to you for your kindness,
but I shall begin to regret that I accepted any benefit at
your hands.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Lynton. On my honor I was not
thinking of you. The money I settled was on my wife’s
brother, and you are not under the slightest obligation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
towards me. If you had not been Mildred’s brother, I
should have seen you damned before giving you a penny,
so you may make your mind easy. I never professed to
like you personally, for you always struck me as being
one of those ultra-self-satisfied people, who are an offense
to the mere ordinary person. One only has to look at
you to know that you appreciate yourself at your full
value—and a little over. Forgive my plain speech, but
you rather brought it upon yourself.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton looked curiously at Gaunt, and knew not
whether to resent this frankness; but he quickly remembered
his mission, and forced a rather sickly smile to his
face.</p>

<p>“It is a good thing to hear an opinion of oneself. But
let us return to the Congo. I want you to promise to
give up this crusade. It can’t really mean very much to
you, and you will be doing me a great favor. Naturally
the foreign office know that you are my brother-in-law,
and——”</p>

<p>“They may think the less of you for possessing such
an undesirable relative? I am afraid I can give you no
such promise, for instead of relaxing my efforts, I intend
to redouble them, until I force the government to intervene,”
Gaunt said, and the voice was grimly determined.</p>

<p>“Governments are not moved so easily, and you will
only injure yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have already done that, for I am pretty sure that
the Belgians are responsible for the Amanti exposure.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason why you should do as I ask,”
the Earl broke in quickly.</p>

<p>“Do I interrupt you?” Lady Mildred called from the
doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“No. Come in, for I don’t think that your brother
has much more to say,” Gaunt answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, come in, Mildred, and help me to persuade your
husband to be sensible,” the Earl cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, and sat on the arm of
Gaunt’s chair, allowing her hand to rest on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Sir Keith Hamilton wants him to stop this Congo
agitation, and he flatly refuses,” Lord Lynton answered,
and there was wonder in his voice that any one dare oppose
the wishes of such an august official as the foreign
secretary.</p>

<p>“I do not intend to interfere. John must decide for
himself, and I shall be content with his decision,” she answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“You are a very dutiful wife, and a foolish woman. I
did think that you would have more common sense,
Mildred,” he cried angrily; and then turned to Gaunt.
“Is this your final decision?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, and I keep my word,” he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“Sir Keith must have anticipated this, for he said that
if I were unsuccessful, I was to ask you to go and see
him at the foreign office,” the Earl said reluctantly, for his
lack of success would be a reflection upon his diplomacy.</p>

<p>A smile came to Gaunt’s face, and he looked at his
wife as he answered.</p>

<p>“I fear that I must refuse Sir Keith’s invitation. If he
wants to see me, he must come here.”</p>

<p>“The foreign secretary come to you!” the Earl cried
in an amazed tone.</p>

<p>“Yes. But you may tell him that his visit will be a
useless one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Gaunt, I don’t understand you. I think you must be
mad.”</p>

<p>“Let us join the others,” Lady Mildred cried hurriedly,
for she saw a glint appear in her husband’s eye,
and she had no wish that they should quarrel.</p>

<p>“Very well, dear,” Gaunt said with a laugh, and the
Earl followed them slowly.</p>

<p>During the rest of the evening there was no further
reference to the subject, but Gaunt now and then caught
Lord Lynton looking at him with a curious expression in
his eyes.</p>

<p>In the morning the two men met in the library where
the Earl was surrounded by the morning papers, most of
which bore evidence of having been impatiently thrown
aside.</p>

<p>“Gaunt, you must do something. The papers are
making a feature of this Amanti business, and it ought
to be stopped. Get your lawyer man to threaten them
with a libel action.”</p>

<p>“For telling the truth. No, I intend to let them go
their own way.”</p>

<p>“It is scandalous,” the Earl cried hotly, but Gaunt only
smiled. In fact he had just left his wife and could still
feel her kiss upon his lips, so these troubles were things
that did not matter.</p>

<p>When Edward Drake came in, the Earl at once
tackled him.</p>

<p>“I understand, sir, that you are Gaunt’s adviser?”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” Drake asked quickly.</p>

<p>“He has probably been talking to Lady Ethel,”
Gaunt answered quickly.</p>

<p>“If you have any influence with Mr. Gaunt, pray induce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
him to reconsider his decision. As his near relative,
I wish him to do two things—to stamp out these
vermin who are attacking him, and to cease this Congo
agitation. Don’t you agree with me that I am only reasonable?”
the Earl asked warmly.</p>

<p>“No. I know the whole facts of the Amanti business.
Gaunt did wrong, and he must suffer for his wrong-doing.
As to the Congo, he would dishonor himself if
he turned back,” Drake answered quietly.</p>

<p>“You speak as a clergyman?” the Earl cried angrily.</p>

<p>“I speak as a Christian and a man. May I suggest
that you allow Mr. Gaunt to manage his own affairs?
For I assure you that he is quite capable of doing so.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton plainly showed his annoyance.</p>

<p>“Gaunt—I am now going to the foreign office,” he
said curtly.</p>

<p>“You may convey my answer to the foreign secretary.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton left the room, as he did not wish to lose
his temper, for he knew that he was a match for neither
of these strong, self-contained men.</p>

<p>“His lordship is angry,” Drake said with a smile.</p>

<p>“And has reason to be, if you look at it from his point
of view. Have you seen the morning papers?” Gaunt
asked casually.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I am sorry that this thing has come out at
the present moment. I suppose there can be no doubt
that the Baron is behind it?”</p>

<p>“No doubt at all, and they will probably work the
trial so that I am subpœnaed to attend. It might even
be possible to get Weiss and myself in the dock on a
charge of conspiracy. However, I am prepared for any
development.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“You are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“Of nothing, for I have my wife’s confidence—and
her love,” he added so quietly that Drake could scarcely
catch the words.</p>

<p>However, he understood and he placed his hand on
Gaunt’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I am very glad, and have only one regret,” he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“That you did not tell your wife everything. She is a
noble woman and large-minded enough to have forgiven,
if you had confessed. But if she finds out from any one
else——”</p>

<p>“I won’t think it possible,” Gaunt cried passionately,
and there was horror in his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lord Lynton</span> did not look forward to his interview
with Sir Keith Hamilton, but there was
nothing to be gained by postponement, for he
was satisfied that there was no chance of being able to
persuade Gaunt to change his mind. Accordingly he
went to the foreign office at once, and was admitted
into the presence of his chief.</p>

<p>“Have you been successful?” the latter asked quickly.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mr. Gaunt absolutely refused to cease this
agitation. It is needless to say that I spared no effort to
get him to fall in with your wishes, but he is quite obstinate.
He is an extremely difficult man to handle,” the
Earl said apologetically.</p>

<p>“So I should imagine. Please tell me everything that
took place. Pray be as accurate as possible.”</p>

<p>And Lord Lynton proceeded to relate in detail their
conversation, while the foreign secretary listened attentively.</p>

<p>“A strong man, your brother-in-law. I must see
what I can do with him. When is he coming here?”</p>

<p>“I regret to say that he refuses to come at all,” the
Earl answered hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is serious, for it sounds like a declaration
of war,” the minister said slowly.</p>

<p>“He intimated that if you wished to see him you
would find him at Gaunt House. I am very sorry that I
have not been more successful, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>“So am I,” Sir Keith answered drily, and then lapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>The Earl fidgeted in his chair, for he began to imagine
that his presence had been forgotten, but suddenly he
felt a pair of piercing gray eyes turned towards him.</p>

<p>“You had better remain in London for the present.
Are you staying with Mr. Gaunt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Remain there, for you may be useful. Just one
question, and it is rather a delicate one. What attitude
does Lady Mildred take up? Of course you spoke to
her on the subject?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I am sorry to say that she backs up her
husband. She seems to have changed a good deal since
her marriage.”</p>

<p>“Gaunt is evidently a man with a personality, and I
shall be interested to meet him.”</p>

<p>“You intend to go to his house?” the Earl cried in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, but there is no necessity to mention my intention
to Gaunt.”</p>

<p>A secretary had entered and placed a piece of paper
before Sir Keith.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will see the Baron, but not until I ring.
Good-evening, my lord. Please keep in constant touch
with the office,” the latter remarked to the Earl, who
then left the room.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, Sir Keith rose and began
to pace to and fro. It was evident that he was thinking
deeply, and now one could see that the first impression of
youth was false, for there were deep lines on his clean
shaven face, and the hair near his temples was turning gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>Then he took up a précis which told him of the latest
developments in the Congo agitation, and his brows became
puckered into a frown as he read.</p>

<p>“This man must be stopped. Now we will see what
the Baron has to say,” he muttered irritably, and then
touched the button of the electric bell.</p>

<p>The two men were old acquaintances, and had a
mutual respect for one another’s ability. The Baron
possessed an advantage for he knew that Sir Keith was a
straightforward gentleman, and incapable of chicanery
and underhand dealing.</p>

<p>“I expected you before this, Baron. You have been
in London some few days,” the minister remarked, as he
returned the Belgian’s elaborate bow.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Excellency, but I have had very much to
occupy my time. Pray forgive the delay in paying my
call,” the Baron answered politely.</p>

<p>“It is not difficult to guess what has occupied you.
For one word—Gaunt?”</p>

<p>“Your guess is a shrewd one; and in this case I think
our interests are identical. Do you not agree with me?”</p>

<p>“It depends where your interests lie?”</p>

<p>“It is evident—in stopping Gaunt from raising this
clamor. It is not necessary for us to discuss the
international situation, for you know it better than I do.
It suffices to say that this agitation is against your
interests and ours.”</p>

<p>“I do not know that it affects my government very
greatly, but I can quite understand that you would
object to this exposure. Why not remedy the state of
affairs in the Congo, for sooner or later you will have to
do so?” Sir Keith said significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“We are doing our utmost to improve the status of
the natives, but these things cannot be done in a
moment,” the Baron expostulated.</p>

<p>“That is the official voice that speaks. Unofficially
I tell you that the treatment of the natives is as bad as
ever it was, and you know it. But it is useless discussing
that; I will drop you a friendly hint. You are reaching
the end of your tether.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith spoke very seriously, and his eyes did not
leave the Baron’s face.</p>

<p>“Of course you are speaking unofficially,” the latter
said quietly.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Sir Keith rejoined drily; “and now may I
know what I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Close the mouth of this man, Gaunt.”</p>

<p>“That is not an easy matter. England is a free
country, and prides itself upon its freedom of speech. So
far Gaunt has not given us any grounds for interference.”</p>

<p>“But the agitation is increasing by leaps and bounds.
The situation may become dangerous.”</p>

<p>“You are afraid that His Majesty’s government may
be forced by the clamor to intervene in the Congo. Put
an end to the abuses and you will have no cause for
anxiety. I regret that I cannot help you, Baron.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith rose to terminate the interview, but de
Croiseuil made no sign of going.</p>

<p>“A word from you to Gaunt would make him stop,”
he said doggedly.</p>

<p>“This is not Belgium. An official, however high he
may be, is not such an exalted person as in your
country. Good-morning, Baron,” Sir Keith said decidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“I shall esteem it a favor if you will glance through
these papers. I see that you are a busy man, and I will
call again for your opinion. I have the honor of
wishing good-day to your Excellency.”</p>

<p>And the Baron, having placed a large envelope on the
table, bowed himself from the room. The foreign
secretary took out the papers, and it was evident that
his interest was aroused from the outset, for he read on
till he had thoroughly mastered each document. This
done he left the office and walked rapidly to his club,
where he ate a frugal lunch, and afterwards went to the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>“The Baron’s little game is very clever, but will it
succeed?”</p>

<p>He asked himself the question but could come to no
decision.</p>

<p>“Perhaps an interview with Gaunt will give me the
answer,” he said musingly and having finished his cigar,
he started walking rapidly to Park Lane.</p>

<p>None recognized him save a policeman, for he was a
man who loathed advertisement, and considered that he
was most successful as a foreign secretary when his
name was least in evidence. By the time he reached
Gaunt’s house, his mind was made up as to the course
he should take at the coming interview.</p>

<p>There was a few minutes’ wait in the hall, and he
noticed with approval the quiet taste with which the
place was furnished.</p>

<p>“Evidently Lady Mildred was consulted,” was the
thought, but in this he was wrong, for Gaunt had chosen
everything, even before he had dreamt of marriage.</p>

<p>To his knowledge Sir Keith had never seen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
millionaire, and so he looked with keen interest at the
man who greeted him, noting the strong face and air of
self-reliance.</p>

<p>“The mountain would not come to Mahomet——But
I am afraid that quotation is unappropriate, for I certainly
am no prophet, Mr. Gaunt. May I sit down?”</p>

<p>Sir Keith had held out his hand, and felt Gaunt’s
steady grip.</p>

<p>“There is nothing flabby in this man’s nature,” was
his thought, and he braced himself up for a battle.</p>

<p>He sank back luxuriously in the big armchair, while
Gaunt brought a box of cigars.</p>

<p>“Will you smoke, sir?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I suppose you know what I have come
about. It was very good of you to invite me to your
house. Quite a pleasant change from my office. This
room is very restful; and if I were a rich man I should
choose just such a place. Ah, I see you have excellent
taste in books. Isn’t that a Caxton?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we had better get our business
over, and then the library is at your service,” Gaunt
answered, and the respectful tone removed any suspicion
of rudeness.</p>

<p>Sir Keith gave him a quick glance, for he was not
accustomed to be answered quite in this way. It was
usually his rôle to lead a conversation.</p>

<p>“I will be frank and blunt. Why are you carrying on
this insane crusade? You can do no good to the natives
of the Congo, and you will only injure yourself. In addition,
it is very embarrassing to me as foreign secretary,
for I tell you it is utterly impossible to do anything
more than I have done. Perhaps in a few months’ time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
the political atmosphere will have cleared, and then we
may be able to do more than make representations to the
Belgian government. I may say that, as a private individual,
I sympathize with all you are doing. In the
past the conduct of the Congo officials has been diabolical,
and according to the evidence which I have been receiving
up to the last week or so, they are not improving
matters. I read your first speech, and I agree with you
that the Belgians intend to exploit the Congo until they
have exhausted the country. I agree with you that there
is no faith to be placed in their promises of reform, and
that their present budget proves them to be liars. This
is said in confidence, as man to man. I believe I have
the reputation of not being callous or hard-hearted, and
if it were possible I would intervene at once. But I tell
you solemnly and sincerely that at present we can go no
farther than to make representations. You are only considering
the Congo. I must think of the well-being of
the British Empire. The present is a time of great
danger, for a spark might start a war which would appal
mankind. It is my duty to avoid every possibility of
causing a spark. It is my opinion that if we intervene by
force, there would be danger of war with another country,
and I dare not run the risk. I am not usually a man of
many words, but I have spoken at such length so that
you may fully understand my position. Now I ask you
to cease this public outcry.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith had risen, and stood face to face with Gaunt.
Their eyes met, and for a while neither spoke. At last
the foreign secretary uttered a little sigh and turned away.</p>

<p>“And that answer is final?” he asked wearily, although
Gaunt had not spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Absolutely. I thank you for coming to see me. I
thought you to be a very different man, and I now see
that it was a petty act—my refusal to go to you. Pray
forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I, too, was mistaken in you, Mr. Gaunt. Whatever
may be your motive, I do not think it is an unworthy
one. It is a pity that your life has not been different.
England can do with such men as yourself.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Again the two men eyed one another steadily.</p>

<p>“I won’t insult you by pressing you to change your
mind.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith sighed once more, and now his face seemed
to have aged.</p>

<p>“By the bye, I must warn you of one thing. We
have not mentioned the Baron de Croiseuil, but you have
probably realized that he is your bitterest enemy. I
don’t think I shall be betraying a confidence, if I tell you
that an application will be made at Bow Street at once.
It concerns the death on the Congo of a man named
Marillier, and proceedings will be taken for your extradition
to that country on a charge of murder.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face was set, and his mouth was drawn into a
grim line, but he did not falter.</p>

<p>“It was a kindness to tell me,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>Sir Keith Hamilton gave Gaunt a glance of admiration
and then continued deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“It is evident that this summons for extradition is a
move upon the part of the Baron de Croiseuil to discredit
you, and I assure you that he will not have my
support,” he said with quiet emphasis.</p>

<p>“It is very good of you to tell me this, sir, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
after the attitude I have taken up,” Gaunt answered
earnestly.</p>

<p>“I don’t profess to understand your motive for stirring
up this agitation, and I don’t ask for your confidence,
but——”</p>

<p>He paused expressively, and there was an expression
of inquiry on his face. Gaunt knew not what to say, for
how could he give his real motive—the vow? And that
was not the sole reason, for now he was animated by a
keen desire to defeat those who were attacking him so
spitefully. His love of fighting had been raised to fever-heat,
and yet he could not explain those mingled feelings
to the foreign secretary.</p>

<p>“I do not fear this police court business, sir. But I
thank you for your kindness. Will you answer me one
question frankly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sir Keith answered with a friendly smile, for
he felt greatly drawn to this man and would gladly have
helped him in any way that was possible.</p>

<p>“However great becomes this agitation for reform in
the Congo, however great pressure is brought to bear
upon you as foreign secretary, shall you stick to what
you have just told me, namely, that you will go no further
than making representations to the Belgian government?”
Gaunt asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“That is as far as I intend to go, unless there is a
very material alteration in the international position in
Europe.”</p>

<p>“Which isn’t likely!”</p>

<p>“Which is very improbable. And now I hope
that you will give me the assurance for which I have
asked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“I regret that it is impossible, but believe me, Sir
Keith, that I shall always be grateful to you for the consideration
you have shown me to-day. If, in the future,
I am fated to act contrary to your wishes and in a way
that you will condemn, I ask you to think of me as
leniently as possible,” Gaunt said, and his voice shook a
little.</p>

<p>“I don’t know at what you are hinting, Mr. Gaunt;
but when this Congo agitation is forgotten I can only say
that I should like to know you. It seems to me that
we have many interests in common. May I look round
your shelves? I still have an hour to spare,” Sir Keith
said genially.</p>

<p>And Gaunt proceeded to point out his treasures, and
the talk became animated, as they discussed the beauties
of some of the rare volumes. The Shakespeare folios
came in for great attention, and Sir Keith was frankly envious.</p>

<p>“What it is to be a poor man when money will buy
such things as these,” he said with a sigh.</p>

<p>While they were in the midst of their engrossing talk
Lady Mildred came in, for she had been made anxious
by their long conference. Tea was served and Sir Keith
showed her great attention, but all the time he was
studying the husband and wife, and soon came to the
conclusion that they loved one another. For a moment
he was tempted to try to use Lady Mildred in a last attempt
to influence Gaunt, but quickly the idea was dismissed
as an unworthy one. And at last he rose.</p>

<p>“I hope to be able to follow up this meeting with
your husband, if he will allow me to do so,” he said to
her pleasantly, and that was the only occasion on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
he made a remark that might have been construed as a
reference to the Congo question.</p>

<p>When he had gone Gaunt turned to his wife and
spoke with deep earnestness.</p>

<p>“That is a man, Mildred, and I hate to have to fight
against him. But——”</p>

<p>He broke off, for her arms were round him and she
kissed him passionately.</p>

<p>“No stupid politics, an you love me,” she whispered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Gaunt</span> understood that Sir Keith was not bluffing
in what he had said, and this knowledge
made a complete change in his plans. After
dinner he summoned Edward Drake and his brother to
the library, and proceeded to inform them of what had
taken place, but did not mention the Marillier affair.
Lady Mildred came in soon after he had begun to speak
and she drew back when she saw them so deeply engaged.</p>

<p>“Drake, I wondered if we might take Lady Mildred
into our confidence?” Gaunt asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Edward Drake did not answer at once, for he saw
danger ahead. As a matter of fact Gaunt had spoken
upon the impulse of the moment—a rare occurrence—and
now it was difficult to draw back. Indeed, Lady
Mildred did not give him an opportunity for she drew a
chair close to her husband.</p>

<p>“Although I am a woman I can keep a secret,” she
said reproachfully to Edward Drake, and he flushed a
little but made no reply.</p>

<p>“To understand, Mildred, you must first realize that
Mr. Drake and myself have vowed,” he flushed as he
spoke the word, “have vowed to help the natives of the
Congo whatever may be the cost to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt may also count me as having made the
same vow,” Lindsay Drake broke in eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“From my interview with the foreign secretary, I am
convinced that there can be no help from the British
government, however great the agitation may become.
That being so we must fall back upon the plan we mentioned
some time ago, and there must be no time lost in
putting it into execution,” Gaunt said slowly and expressively.</p>

<p>“You mean the ‘cruiser’ scheme,” Lindsay Drake
cried, and his eyes were alight with excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have ascertained that at the present moment
there is a small cruiser undergoing her trials. She
was built on the Tyne for the San Salvador Republic
and is the very ship for us, especially as the San
Salvador finances are in a bad state, and they are hard
pushed to find money. Our first step is to begin negotiations
with the San Salvador representatives, and I
think that they will jump at the idea, so that we ought to
be able to hire the cruiser at a reasonable price. It is
important that my name shall not appear in the negotiations
for I anticipate that the Baron will be closely
watching my every movement. My difficulty is to find
a man to conduct this negotiation.”</p>

<p>“I will do it,” Lindsay Drake cried quickly.</p>

<p>“You hold a commission in the army. It may be
dangerous work,” Gaunt answered.</p>

<p>“I am willing to run the risk.”</p>

<p>“I think I am the more suitable person in every way,”
Edward Drake intervened.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” Gaunt answered, “for I have
other work for your brother. The engineers and artificers
will be easily found, for we are willing to pay them
well. But the other men will require careful selection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
We shall want a number of men with military training,
and can you find them? They must not be ‘wasters,’
and they must be able to hold their tongues. My present
idea is that these men should concentrate at the
Canary Islands where the cruiser could pick them up.
Can I leave this part of the business in your hands?”
Gaunt asked of Captain Drake.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I can manage it. At the present moment
I know dozens of men—gentlemen—who would
be keen at the chance of going with us, just for the fun
of the thing. I am one of them,” the latter answered.</p>

<p>“It is a mad idea,” Lady Mildred cried vehemently,
“and a dangerous one. Should you go on the cruiser?”
she asked with a look of anxiety at her husband.</p>

<p>“I could not very well let the others go and stay at
home,” Gaunt answered with a smile. “At first, the
scheme may seem a little mad, but if you look into it
you will see that it is quite feasible. As soon as we
leave the Canary Islands we shall be all right. The
danger is that our plans may be discovered before we
can get away. There is that wretched Foreign Enlistment
Act.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I can get the right sort of men who won’t
blab,” Lindsay Drake said confidently.</p>

<p>They proceeded to discuss their plans in detail, and it
was decided that negotiations should be commenced the
next day for the hiring of the cruiser. Lady Mildred did
not interrupt them and upon realizing that their talk was
likely to be a prolonged one, she rose, and bade them
good-night.</p>

<p>Captain Drake was the next to depart for he expected
Gaunt and his brother wished to be alone, and in this he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
was right. But there was silence for some time after he
had gone, until Gaunt began to tell of his interview with
the foreign secretary which concerned the Marillier affair.</p>

<p>“And there can be no doubt that the Baron will
carry out his threat,” he wound up.</p>

<p>“He is a dangerous enemy, and the terrible part is
that we can do nothing. Do you think that the
magistrate would be likely to send you to the Congo for
trial?” Drake asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“It is extremely unlikely, for I don’t see how they
can get the evidence. Indeed, I am not certain that the
Baron expects to succeed. He merely wishes to blacken
my character and close my mouth. There is the Amanti
deal and this coming on the top of it will be likely to
make the public believe that I am not the kind of man
who would be interested in the Congo, merely out of
consideration for the welfare of the natives. And the
public would have been right in thinking that a little
time ago. In fact I myself find it difficult to know what
is my real motive. A good deal to do with it is a
natural love of a fight.”</p>

<p>“You are not just to yourself, for I am convinced that
you are as desirous as I am to help the natives. Don’t
think me impertinent if I say that I have noticed
changes in your character. When we first met you
were a hard man and devoid of human sympathy. You
have allowed me to see something of the real Gaunt and
I understand the reason of your change. But do you
think you were wise to let your wife know of our
plans?” Drake asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question?” Gaunt cried impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“Remember her first remark. She wished to know if
you yourself would go. Naturally she imagines that
there would be danger in such an expedition and she
loves you; need I say more?”</p>

<p>“My wife will not try to persuade me to stay at home,”
Gaunt answered grimly.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that.”</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss it,” Gaunt broke in quickly.
“Last night I did not sleep very well and in my mind
I went over everything I had done since we first met.
Tell me honestly, have I so far carried out my vow?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You have done as much as mortal man could
do. I have been afraid, at times, that you had lost sight
of that motive, and were acting from a wish to get the
better of the Baron. May I tell you what is in my
mind?” Drake asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I prefer absolute frankness.”</p>

<p>“I have been afraid that now you have won your
wife’s love you would weaken in your purpose. You
have obtained all that you desired, and I thought that
the temptation to enjoy your happiness would be too
great.”</p>

<p>“I have been tempted, Drake, but I am not that sort
of man. I made a bargain and will carry it out faithfully.”</p>

<p>“And if Lady Mildred tries to persuade you to give
it up?” Drake persisted.</p>

<p>“I said before that she will not do so. If she does, it
will make no difference.”</p>

<p>“But already you have given in, for you had determined
that you would not try to win your wife until you
could go to her with clean hands.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face flushed at the rebuke, for he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
deny its justice, and it was impossible to explain that he
had made no effort to win Lady Mildred, so he remained
silent.</p>

<p>“I have a presentiment that misfortune is near at
hand. Gaunt, won’t you go to your wife and tell her of
that other thing? It seems to me that you have gained
her love under false pretenses,” Drake continued in a
low voice.</p>

<p>Gaunt rose from his chair and uttered an exclamation
of anger.</p>

<p>“Drake, you are going too far,” he cried vehemently,
for the accusation had struck home.</p>

<p>“I only wish to save you from great trouble, and it is
not an easy task to say these things for I recognize what
a hard task I am setting you. Remember your vow—you
promised that your future life should be lived in
accordance with the teaching of Christ. It was an
almost superhuman task that you set yourself, for you
lacked belief in the love of Christ and the Christian
spirit which alone could give you the strength to carry
out your determination. Don’t think I want to preach
to you, Gaunt, but I fear that you will fail, unless you
force yourself to regard everything from a different point
of view. You told me that you believe that God had
given you your wife’s life in answer to your prayer. Do
you still believe that?” Drake asked gently.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was a strained look in Gaunt’s eyes as he
whispered the single word.</p>

<p>“Then you must believe in the efficacy of prayer.
Ask God to give you the strength to make a complete
confession to Lady Mildred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot do it,” Gaunt answered miserably.</p>

<p>Drake sighed wearily and rising stood face to face
with the man, whom he longed so intensely to help.</p>

<p>“God did not fail you when you prayed in desperation.
Go to Him again.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken with deep earnestness and
Gaunt was moved, but there was ever before him the
fear of the distress that would come into his wife’s eyes,
when she should hear his miserable story.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell her for you?” Drake insisted quietly.</p>

<p>“No, no!” was the vehement answer. “I am not
such an abject coward.”</p>

<p>Gaunt turned away with a groan and began to pace
restlessly to and fro, while Drake’s eyes followed him,
filled with eager expectation. It was some time before
either of them spoke but at last Gaunt stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“I will not make you a promise which I may not be
able to fulfil, but I will think it over,” he said with a
roughness that was intended to hide his weakness.</p>

<p>After a tight grip of the hands the men parted, and
Gaunt went straight to his wife’s room, for he felt sure
that she had not gone to bed.</p>

<p>In fact Lady Mildred had been anxiously awaiting him
for she wished to talk over with him the scheme which
had been unfolded in her presence, but at the sight of
his white face she quickly determined to postpone the
discussion. Gaunt was surprised at her silence upon the
subject, but their love was a new and very precious
thing, and as they sat before the fire his indecision vanished.</p>

<p>They were both supremely happy, and their eyes would
meet, brimming over with the love that they found so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
strangely sweet. And Gaunt knew that he would never
have the courage to jeopardize all that made life worth
the living.</p>

<p>Her upbringing was such a one as would cause her to
regard with horror the shedding of blood, and she would
not be able to understand how it had happened. Then,
too, there were such sordid surroundings, which it would
be impossible for him to explain.</p>

<p>When she left him he sat there for a while, and his
thoughts were not pleasant, for it was impossible to
conceal from himself that he was not honestly carrying
out his vow. Drake’s words had disturbed him, and he
found it difficult to quiet his awakened conscience.</p>

<p>At last he went to his dressing-room and threw off his
coat, but his actions were very slow, and now and then
he would stop and stand still with a frown on his face.</p>

<p>When he had finished undressing a sudden impulse
seized him, and he sank on to his knees beside the bed.
Words would not come and still he did not move. His
eyes were closed, and his quick breathing could be
heard.</p>

<p>The door opened quietly, and Lady Mildred stood in
the doorway, a look of surprise springing to her face.
But she uttered no word, and left as silently as she had
entered, and Gaunt wrestled with himself.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Baron De Croiseuil</span> had half expected to
hear from Gaunt, for he imagined that the papers
which he had left with Sir Keith Hamilton might
have caused that gentleman to communicate with the
millionaire, with the idea of persuading him into silence.
A couple of days passed and it was very evident that
something must be done without delay, and the Baron
reluctantly decided to cause an application to be made at
Bow Street to secure a warrant for Gaunt’s arrest. By
this time numerous documents had arrived from Brussels,
and among them were affidavits sufficiently strong to
make out a prima facie case of murder. There were
numberless ex-Congo officials in Belgium who would be
prepared to swear to anything for a consideration, for
their morals were warped, and their greed for gold insatiable.</p>

<p>So the Baron interviewed Mr. Simon Stone—the
notorious solicitor, who was engaged in every case where
dirty work was required to be done skillfully, and gave
him full instructions. But as he walked back to his hotel,
de Croiseuil was not altogether satisfied with what he
had done, for he knew that his case was a weak one, and
that the arrest of John Gaunt would cause a great outcry.
But it was not his wish to proceed to that extremity, and
as he strolled along Piccadilly, he saw approaching a
gentleman, at the sight of whom he uttered an exclamation
of satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“It is really a pleasure to see you. I did not know
you were in London,” he began effusively.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton, for it was he, did not at first recognize
the Baron, for it was some time since they had met, but
recollection came at last.</p>

<p>“You are looking very fit,” he remarked politely.</p>

<p>“Will you not come as far as the Ritz with me? It is
just time for déjeuner, and you are the very man I
wanted to see.”</p>

<p>The Earl hesitated, and the Baron continued quickly.</p>

<p>“It concerns your brother-in-law, Mr. Gaunt. For the
sake of your family, I ask you to come,” he wound up
earnestly.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton no longer hesitated, and the two men
hastened along in silence, but as soon as they had entered
the sitting-room, the Baron’s face grew very grave.</p>

<p>“It was fortunate that we met, as your lordship may
prevent something very like a tragedy from taking place.
But we will not talk till we have eaten,” he said, and
ringing the bell, ordered that lunch should be served
immediately.</p>

<p>The meal was short but excellent and the Baron did
justice to it, but the Earl was evidently occupied with his
thoughts, which were the reverse of pleasant. To do
him justice, he had ceased to consider himself, although
it was very unpleasant to read each day the attacks upon
the man who was his brother-in-law. But Lady Mildred
must be protected and he remembered that Gaunt had
been confident that the Baron was responsible for the
articles appearing against him in the newspapers.</p>

<p>“What is this tragedy of which you speak?” he asked
as they lighted their cigarettes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“First of all, I want you to bear in mind that I am
only doing my duty. I have a great admiration for Mr.
Gaunt, and I deeply regret the necessity of harming him.
You are aware of what has happened, and so it is unnecessary
to weary you with details. You know that he
has turned on his old friends in a scandalous manner, and
is raising a bitter but unjustified feeling against my country.
May I ask a question? Have you come to England
owing to this?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the Earl answered quietly.</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought I could trace the cunning hand of
my friend Sir Keith. But I fear you have been unsuccessful
in your mission. Gaunt is terribly obstinate.
May I ask if Sir Keith mentioned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’affaire Marillier</i>?”</p>

<p>“No. This is the first I have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“It is a most deplorable business, but I think that it is
as well that you should know, for it concerns Mr. Gaunt.
I will be very short, and simply say that Marillier was
one of our officials who met with an untimely end, for he
was shot by a brother official. In fact he was murdered,
and the man who killed him was John Gaunt,” the Baron
said quietly.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton rose to his feet, and looked down at the
Belgian in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“You are accusing Mr. Gaunt of murder?” he cried
harshly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is very unfortunate, and I am greatly distressed,
especially as I have this morning given instructions
that an application shall be made for a warrant for
his arrest. Pray believe that I hated having to do this,
but <em>helas</em>, I am but a subordinate, and I am compelled
to obey orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“This affair must have happened many years ago.
May I ask you why you have only just thought of
taking proceedings?”</p>

<p>The Baron did not answer, but shrugged his shoulders
expressively.</p>

<p>“Your motive is quite clear. You have no hope that
he will be found guilty, but you think that by this means
you will discredit him. Baron, your conduct is in
keeping with your other actions in the Congo. It is a
knavish trick,” the Earl cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>“It is unwise to insult me, whose only wish is to be
your friend. We will not discuss the ethics of the
matter, but I will hint that these proceedings may be
still stopped by a simple promise.”</p>

<p>“I understand. You wish me to tell Gaunt that if he
will shut up, you are willing to drop <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’affaire Marillier</i>.”</p>

<p>“Precisely, and I am sure that you will appreciate
which way Gaunt’s interests lie. There is also his wife,
Lady Mildred, to be considered. You are her brother,
and surely you have the right to speak forcibly. If you
succeed, not only will you be doing me a favor
but——”</p>

<p>“I have not the slightest wish to do you a favor,” the
Earl cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>“It matters not, so long as you bring about the
desired end. I was about to say that you will also be
pleasing Sir Keith Hamilton. Perhaps this fact will
appeal to you,” the Baron said drily.</p>

<p>“Do you say that you have actually given the lawyer
instructions to apply for a warrant?” the Earl demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes. A few hours ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“Then there is no time to be lost. I presume that
you have the power of stopping the proceedings if
Gaunt submits to what you want?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Extradition matters are different from your
criminal law. All you need do is to ’phone me that
Mr. Gaunt has become reasonable, and I will see to the
rest. You are going, my lord. Then I will wait here
till I hear from you.”</p>

<p>The two men exchanged bows, and Lord Lynton
hurried to the door, where he was fortunate enough to
get a taxi-cab without any delay. He had seen but little
of John Gaunt, for his brother-in-law had been very
busy, and had been away each day until dinner time, so
that he was not very hopeful of finding him at Park
Lane.</p>

<p>“Is your master in?” he demanded of the footman
who answered the ring.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord. He is with her ladyship, in her ladyship’s
room.”</p>

<p>The Earl ran rapidly up the stairs, and found Gaunt
and Lady Mildred engaged in admiring the baby. In
fact they were laughing heartily as they watched the
infant’s lusty kicks.</p>

<p>“Gaunt, I want a word with you. Will you come to
the library?” Lord Lynton said almost curtly, and Lady
Mildred gave him a quick look of curiosity.</p>

<p>She rang the bell for the nurse, and then rested her
hand on her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>“I will come with you. Geoffrey, you look very
tragic,” she remarked lightly.</p>

<p>But he was not in the mood for bandying words, and
his lips were tightly pressed together as he faced them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Mildred, you appear to enjoy your husband’s confidence.
Has he told you of the Marillier business?” he
asked coldly.</p>

<p>“No. What is it? But don’t answer, for John may
not wish me to know,” she added quickly.</p>

<p>For the moment Gaunt was tempted to seize this
loophole and escape, but only for a moment. He could
still feel her hand resting on his arm, so very gently he
disengaged it.</p>

<p>“You have the right to know, but you should have
heard it from me, coward that I am,” he muttered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>And he blamed himself bitterly for his weakness.
What a fool he had been in not following Edward
Drake’s advice.</p>

<p>His words drove the color from Lady Mildred’s face,
for she realized that she was about to hear something
that might affect the happiness which these last few days
had been well-nigh perfect. And instinctively she drew
closer to the man whom she had grown to love so
passionately.</p>

<p>“I have just come from the Baron de Croiseuil, and he
tells me that a warrant is about to be issued for your
arrest,” the Earl announced bluntly.</p>

<p>The sight of his sister’s evident love had driven away
every feeling of compassion, and he wished to hurt this
stern-faced man. But in his desire, Lady Mildred had
been forgotten, and she uttered a cry that wrung his
heart with its pain.</p>

<p>“What does it mean, John? Why should they wish
to arrest you? What have you done?” she cried
breathlessly, and her bosom rose and fell quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Gaunt took her hand in his and there was a great pity
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Mildred, I killed a man, and——”</p>

<p>“The charge is one of murder,” the Earl interrupted
brutally.</p>

<p>To do him justice, it was with a good motive, that of
thoroughly frightening his sister, so that she would
compel Gaunt to give way.</p>

<p>“It cannot be more than manslaughter. I killed a man
but it was in self-defense. Mildred, let me tell you the
whole story,” said Gaunt, and his voice was low with a
note of anguish.</p>

<p>“There is no time for that. I tell you that the warrant
for your arrest may already be issued, but there
is a way to prevent all this trouble. Give me your word
that this Congo agitation shall end, and you will hear no
more of it,” the Earl said slowly and emphatically.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred turned to her husband with a glad
cry.</p>

<p>“Surely you will do that, John? Think what it
means. Although you are innocent, they will drag you
to prison, and—I cannot think of it. Why do you hesitate,
John dearest? Look at me. I love you, John, and
you cannot be so cruel. They will take you from me
and—Geoffrey, go to the Baron at once. Tell him that
John consents,” she cried vehemently.</p>

<p>And John Gaunt struggled with the great temptation
of his life.</p>

<p>“Mildred, you do not turn from me because I killed
this man?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, no, John. But send Geoffrey. Tell him to
go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Gaunt’s face had brightened wonderfully, and he no
longer hesitated.</p>

<p>“Stay,” he cried to the Earl, who had reached the
door.</p>

<p>The latter turned with a look of inquiry on his face.
But he had no doubt that he had won.</p>

<p>“You will not go to the Baron. Let him do his worst,”
Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>“John, you cannot mean it. By our love I implore
you to give way. I will bless you till my dying day.
Think of the baby. Think of me, dearest. They will
take you to prison—you, my husband. I cannot bear
it, John.”</p>

<p>She sank back into a chair and covered her face with
her hands, sobbing passionately.</p>

<p>“You cannot hesitate,” the Earl said harshly.</p>

<p>A knock at the door and Edward Drake entered.</p>

<p>“Gaunt, there is an inspector of police below. He
wishes to see you,” he announced, and there was deep
sympathy on his face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, you have influence with my husband.
He only has to send word to the Baron and the proceedings
will be stopped,” Lady Mildred cried imploringly.
“I know that you do not like me, but you are my husband’s
friend. Advise him to consent.”</p>

<p>In her anguish Lady Mildred had clasped Drake’s
hands and he stood there motionless, with his eyes fixed
on Gaunt.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt will do what he thinks to be right,” he
said, and his voice shook with emotion.</p>

<p>“John, do you still hesitate?” she cried piteously.
“You owe me something. I have given you all the love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
of which I am capable. I have been generous, for I have
sunk my pride, and I will do so again for your happiness.
Speak to me, dearest.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give the Baron the promise he requires,”
Gaunt said, and the fierce attempt to crush down his emotion
made his voice sound hard in his wife’s ears.</p>

<p>With a cry she came towards him, and all appeal had
left her face.</p>

<p>“If you will not do this for me, then I swear that I
will never forgive you. Your love is a pretense.” She
turned suddenly to Drake. “It is your fault. It is
you who make my husband act in this way. Undo
your work or I can make you suffer, for I know that you
care for my sister.”</p>

<p>But as she looked from Drake to her husband, she
knew that it was hopeless, and with a cry of anguish she
fell back into her brother’s arms. Gaunt sprang forward,
kissed her tenderly, and without looking back strode
from the room.</p>

<p>“Curse the vow,” he said savagely to Drake, who accompanied
him.</p>

<p>The inspector had awaited him in the library and he
came forward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I hold a warrant for your arrest,” he said
respectfully.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” Gaunt answered quietly.</p>

<p>And the inspector proceeded to read the warrant, but
he was quickly interrupted.</p>

<p>“I understand the charge,” Gaunt cried impatiently.
“Do you wish to handcuff me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have a taxi-cab at the door.”</p>

<p>“Shall I come with you?” Drake asked quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“No, stay and try to comfort my wife. In the meantime
see that none of our plans are delayed. You
and your brother have full instructions,” Gaunt said
quietly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> the drive to Bow Street Police Station,
John Gaunt could think of nothing else save his
wife’s attitude, and it was with a deep feeling of
relief that he realized his fear had been groundless. It
was not the fact that he had killed Marillier that had
caused her distress, but the danger that he was incurring.
She had appealed to him so passionately, inasmuch as
she feared for his safety, and the thought brought him
comfort.</p>

<p>The warrant was formally read over to him in the
charge room and he was at once conducted to a cell,
there to await the arrival of his solicitor, for whom he had
sent. He was calm and collected when the lawyer arrived.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Stanley,” he remarked
quietly, and then proceeded to relate what had happened.</p>

<p>The solicitor listened attentively, now and then jotting
down a note.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, the best thing you can do is to make
terms with the Baron de Croiseuil,” Mr. Stanley said
when the story was finished.</p>

<p>“You may dismiss that idea from your mind. I intend
to fight him,” Gaunt answered sternly.</p>

<p>“I see,” the solicitor remarked reflectively. “Of
course you are in no great danger, for it is unlikely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
they will convict you after the long delay; but you will
certainly have to put up with a great deal of inconvenience.
I must get away at once, for I should like Sir
Richard Tester to have his brief to-night.”</p>

<p>“You think that he is the best man?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, for he is so ultra-respectable. Mark
my words, the other side will have Lester Ruggles.
Good-bye, Mr. Gaunt, and don’t worry too much. You
are quite sure you won’t make terms with the Baron?”</p>

<p>“Quite. Good-bye,” Gaunt answered laconically.</p>

<p>The cell was not entirely without comfort, and he settled
himself down to wait for the morning. Try as he
would he could not prevent himself from thinking of
Lady Mildred, and he wondered how this wretched business
would affect their relations. However, he told himself
that her love would rise above worldly considerations
and that, when he was free, she would receive him with
open arms.</p>

<p>At last he fell asleep, and it was late when he awakened.
Mr. Stanley arrived soon after ten o’clock and
proceeded to question him closely. He then hurried
away to embody the information he had received in the
brief.</p>

<p>It was not until twelve o’clock that a policeman came
and announced that the magistrate, Sir William Chandler,
had arrived and that his attendance was required.</p>

<p>Gaunt’s face was rather pale, but his expression was
calm when he entered the crowded court. All eyes were
turned upon him, and the pencils of the press men became
busy as he stood in the dock and bowed to the
magistrate.</p>

<p>The charge was read by the clerk, and Mr. Lester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Ruggles, K. C., rose to his feet. He was a barrister of
some fame and, like the solicitor who instructed him, was
retained in cases which counsel of better repute would
refuse to handle. But he was skilled in the law, a biting
cross-examiner, and something of an orator.</p>

<p>“I appear for the prosecution, your Worship, and at
the outset I must ask you to grant an adjournment. I
propose merely to give formal notice of arrest.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know something of the case,” the
magistrate suggested quietly.</p>

<p>For the first time Gaunt allowed his eyes to roam
round the court and he at once saw two ladies heavily
veiled seated a few rows away. It did not need the sight
of Edward Drake to tell him who they were, and his
heart was beating rapidly when he recognized his wife.</p>

<p>“She has not failed me,” was his thought, and instinctively
his shoulders were thrown back, and a smile played
about his mouth.</p>

<p>“The case is a very serious one, for it involves a
charge of murder. I represent the Belgian government,
who are acting for the authorities of the Congo Free
State. Your Worship is probably aware that the Belgian
colonial office has taken over the Free State. Some
fifteen years ago the prisoner, John Gaunt, entered the
service of the Congo.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ruggles, am I to understand that the charge of
murder dates back fifteen years?” the magistrate asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“That is so, sir; but I think I shall be able to put forward
good reasons for the delay. I was saying that the
prisoner entered the services of the Free State, and was
appointed to the charge of a district. It is necessary that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
your Worship should know something of the state of affairs
in that country. I fear that the morals of West Africa
are such that we should not understand in our frigid
climate, and I regret to say that the officials have been
in the habit of providing themselves with native wives.”</p>

<p>The color slowly ebbed from Gaunt’s face as he listened.
There was a touch on his shoulder, and his solicitor
whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“The Baron says there is still time.”</p>

<p>But Gaunt made no answer, and listened eagerly to
what Mr. Ruggles was saying.</p>

<p>“It appears that a man named Marillier possessed such
a wife, but the prisoner cast eyes upon her and determined
to secure her for himself. Accordingly, by some
means or other, he got her away, and as a consequence
Marillier felt aggrieved. A quarrel took place, and the
prisoner deliberately shot the man that he had wronged.”</p>

<p>The words then became a mere jumble to Gaunt’s
mind, and he stood there utterly dazed. At last he summoned
up courage to turn his head and his breath came
with a hiss of apprehension when he saw that his wife
had gone.</p>

<p>Gaunt now understood the unscrupulousness of the
attack upon him, and his lips were tightly pressed together
as he forced himself to listen to the prosecuting
counsel’s lying statement.</p>

<p>“I have here, sir, several affidavits which depose to
the facts I have related, but you will readily understand
that I am not in a position to complete my case. There
are important witnesses in the Congo, and I fear that I
must ask for a long adjournment. That is, unless your
Worship would be prepared to commit the prisoner for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
trial upon these affidavits, and the evidence which I can
obtain immediately from Brussels.”</p>

<p>“It depends entirely upon the nature of that evidence,”
the magistrate remarked drily.</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that the only witnesses of the actual
shooting are natives, and they, of course, are in the
Congo.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that theirs is the only evidence that is
material and I am surprised that you should not have
brought them here before applying for a warrant. Under
the circumstances, your application yesterday should
have been for a summons and not for a warrant.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard Tester rose and spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>“I appear for the prisoner, and I propose to say a few
words on that subject, if my learned friend has quite
finished,” he began in the clear ringing voice, with its
note of gentle persuasion which helped to bring him
renown.</p>

<p>“I would suggest that you grant an adjournment for
a week,” broke in Mr. Ruggles, “when I will proceed to
examine the witnesses at my disposal. I shall then be in
a better position to tell you when my witnesses will arrive
from the Congo.”</p>

<p>“What have you to say, Sir Richard?” the magistrate
asked.</p>

<p>The famous counsel slowly rose and took up his gold-rimmed
eye-glasses with which he proceeded to punctuate
his remarks.</p>

<p>“In the first place, sir, I say with all deliberation that
this is not a bona fide prosecution, and I am surprised
that my learned friend should have lent himself to such a
barefaced proceeding. It is necessary, sir, that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
trouble you at some length, but probably you are aware
that Mr. John Gaunt—I will not call him the prisoner—has
been engaged upon a humane task, that of rousing
the public to a proper appreciation of the terrible
conditions under which the natives of the Congo live.
It is natural to believe that this agitation is distinctly unpalatable
to the governors of the Free State, and I say
that the prosecution has been brought solely with the
idea of discrediting Mr. Gaunt, and rendering him incapable
of continuing what I will term his noble work.
I take the first opportunity of denying the truth of the
statement which you have just heard from counsel, and I
am of opinion that he has been falsely instructed from
motives of malice. It is suggested that my client deliberately
shot the man Marillier under the most discreditable
circumstances, and now I will tell you what really
happened.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard proceeded to speak of Gaunt’s sudden
appearance at the flogging of the native girl, and
the consequences of his interference.</p>

<p>“I suggest that the facts have been deliberately misstated
for the purpose I have before mentioned, and I
maintain that the prosecution has not the slightest hope
of proving what they have put forward. Now I address
a larger public when I express a wish that these proceedings
shall not be allowed to influence Mr. Gaunt’s work,”
he wound up slowly and impressively.</p>

<p>“I am willing to adjourn the case for a week,” the
magistrate remarked.</p>

<p>“As to bail, your Worship?” Sir Richard said suavely.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruggles jumped to his feet, and intervened with
vigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“The charge is that of murder, and I strenuously oppose
bail. The prisoner is a man of such great wealth
that no amount you could fix would deter him from leaving
the country, if he so wished.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that your Worship will not be inclined to
take away Mr. Gaunt’s liberty. I am aware that bail is
very rarely granted in cases of murder, but this accusation
is so frivolous that I am confident that you will see
the justice of my application. I repeat that the sole motive
of this prosecution is to silence my client,” Sir Richard
said with some warmth.</p>

<p>“At this stage I will express no opinion upon the proceedings,
except to remark that the alleged crime took
place many years ago. Mr. Gaunt is a well-known man
and it is natural to wonder why all these years have been
allowed to pass without any steps having been taken. I
shall grant bail—the prisoner giving security in one
thousand pounds—and two other securities of a like
amount.”</p>

<p>“I am obliged to your Worship,” Sir Richard said
quietly.</p>

<p>Gaunt happened to turn round, and his eyes alighted
upon the Baron de Croiseuil, who was talking excitedly
to his solicitor. Mr. Ruggles once more jumped to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Surely your Worship will hear me before giving such
a decision? I repeat that the charge against the prisoner
is the most serious known to the law, and that you
will be forming a most dangerous precedent if you grant
bail. I cannot impress upon your lordship too strongly
my opinion that if the prisoner is allowed to go free, he
will never dare to face the trial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“I have given my decision after due consideration.
The prisoner will be admitted to bail upon the terms I
have stated,” the magistrate answered drily.</p>

<p>Gaunt was led from the court while the formalities
were being completed, and it was some little time before
the papers were signed. At last it was all finished, and
he left the police station to find Edward Drake awaiting
him with the motor-car.</p>

<p>Newspaper lads were running along the street shouting
their wares:</p>

<p>“Serious charge against John Gaunt. Proceedings at
Bow Street,” and a grim smile came to the millionaire’s
face.</p>

<p>“What did Lady Mildred say to you?” he asked of
Drake with great anxiety.</p>

<p>“Nothing. She merely left. Of course she will not
credit the absurd statement made by Ruggles, but naturally
she was upset.”</p>

<p>Gaunt was not listening, for he was filled with a great
anxiety and when the car reached his house he jumped
down and hastened into the hall.</p>

<p>“Where is your mistress?” he demanded of the footman,
and his voice was harsh.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship left half an hour ago, sir.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Her ladyship’s sister, and the nurse with
the baby accompanied her ladyship,” was the answer,
and Gaunt moved slowly away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Lady Mildred realized that her husband
had been arrested and had left the
house in charge of an inspector of police, she
gave way completely and was prostrated with grief.
But she did not lack courage and when Edward Drake
came to see her she forced herself to greet him calmly.</p>

<p>“You are responsible for this,” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I do not think so, but I will not attempt to defend
myself. Mr. Gaunt has acted the part of a brave man
and I honor him,” he answered steadily.</p>

<p>“You honor him for going to prison?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The police court is not always a disgrace.
Some day you will think as I do. Your husband is innocent
of the crime with which he has been charged,
and his accusers know him to be innocent. It is but an
attempt to silence him, and the attempt will fail,” Drake
said with quiet conviction.</p>

<p>Lord Lynton rushed into the room and there was great
excitement on his face.</p>

<p>“I have just been telephoning to the Baron. He tells
me that it is not too late, and if Gaunt will only give the
promise, he will see that these proceedings are stopped.
Mr. Drake, you must follow him to the police station and
make him do this.”</p>

<p>“From your knowledge of Mr. Gaunt’s character, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
should understand that such a visit would be useless.
He has made up his mind and nothing that I or any one
else can say will change his purpose.”</p>

<p>Lady Ethel had followed closely after her brother, who
had explained to her what had happened.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, will you come with me?” she said quietly,
and led the way to the library. “I ask you as a great
favor to go to Mr. Gaunt. I believe you underrate your
influence with him, and that if you try hard he will consent
to give the Baron this promise.”</p>

<p>“I have already said that it would be useless,” he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I am not sure that you believe what you
said. For some purpose of your own you have been
driving Mr. Gaunt on to this mad course. You, and no
one else, are responsible for what he has done. If you
had not entered into his life he would never have given
a second thought to the wrongs of the natives of the
Congo.”</p>

<p>He endeavored to interrupt her but she continued with
greater earnestness.</p>

<p>“Have you not seen how happy they have been
lately? My sister loves him, and I thought that all these
difficulties had vanished. Yesterday Mildred gloried in
her husband’s love, and now he is in prison. I love my
sister dearly, and I cannot see her life ruined.</p>

<p>“I believe that Mr. Gaunt is innocent,” she continued
gravely, “but even then, this charge will cause a great
scandal. Mildred is deeply hurt that he should have refused
to do the little thing she asked, for it would seem
as though he placed this wretched crusade above his
wife’s love. Won’t you go to him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed steadily upon him and he was
deeply moved.</p>

<p>“I shall be very grateful to you, Mr. Drake,” she said
simply.</p>

<p>“I hate to refuse you, but I cannot do it. My conscience
tells me that Mr. Gaunt is doing his duty.”</p>

<p>“And that is your last word?”</p>

<p>“It must be.”</p>

<p>“I am greatly disappointed, not only for my sister’s
sake but for my own. I thought that you were my
friend. I have respected you as much as any man I
know, and now I can only think that you are acting in
this strange way for some secret motive, of which you
are ashamed. You pretend to be Mr. Gaunt’s friend,
while all the time you are proving yourself to be his bitterest
enemy. Under the circumstances, I would suggest
that you leave this house,” she wound up scornfully.</p>

<p>Drake was distressed and knew not what to do. He
could see that no word of his would make her think differently
of him, and yet he would not go.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt’s last words were that I should look after
Lady Mildred,” he answered gravely.</p>

<p>“Look after the woman whose happiness you have
helped to ruin?” she cried contemptuously, and before he
could answer she had hurried away.</p>

<p>And during the whole of the interview he had been
longing to tell her the truth, for he hated to see scorn in
the eyes of the woman he loved. She believed him to
be acting from unworthy motives, and he could not defend
himself.</p>

<p>A broad-minded man, he had mapped out a course of
action from which he would not deviate in the smallest degree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
It was his conviction that the sufferings of the natives
of the Congo could be made to cease by the efforts of
Gaunt, and the misery of millions of human beings he
placed far above every other consideration. What mattered
his own happiness—what mattered the happiness
of Gaunt and Lady Mildred, when such a stake
was at issue?</p>

<p>Just before the dinner hour his brother came in, tired
out with a long day’s work. He was succeeding beyond
his most sanguine expectations and was rapidly getting
together the body of men which Gaunt required. In fact
many of them were to leave for Las Palmas by the next
steamer, there to await instructions.</p>

<p>Lindsay Drake was thoroughly upset by the news of
Gaunt’s arrest, but his brother endeavored to cheer him.</p>

<p>“I believe that God is with us, and that He will
not allow anything to stop us from this good work,” he
said solemnly.</p>

<p>They dined alone, and afterwards continued their discussion
of the arrangements which were already far advanced,
in spite of the very few days which had elapsed
since work had been commenced. Edward Drake had
approached the representatives of San Salvador and had
ascertained that there had been great difficulty in finding
the large sum of money which must be paid before possession
of the cruiser would be granted. Like most
South Americans, Señor Alvarez was quite open to a
bribe and had entertained the proposal with great eagerness.
Now there remained but the details to discuss and
Gaunt’s presence was necessary before the matter could
be finally settled.</p>

<p>It was Edward Drake’s intention to go to the police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
court at an early hour in the morning, but when he was
about to start a message came from Lady Mildred that
she wished to see him, and he hastened to her room.</p>

<p>Her face was pale and dark rims encircled her eyes,
for she had passed a sleepless night, but when she had
awakened a great deal of the bitter feeling against her
husband had passed away.</p>

<p>“John loves me, and nothing else matters,” she told
herself.</p>

<p>When Drake entered she received him quietly, and
silenced his words of sympathy.</p>

<p>“I would rather not talk of it,” she said wearily. “I
have sent for you because I wish you to take me to the
police court. My brother refuses to go.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it wise?” he asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I wish the world to see that I believe in my husband’s
innocence, and the best way of showing it is by
being present.”</p>

<p>“I, too, intend to go,” Lady Ethel announced from
the doorway, but she took no notice of Edward Drake,
not even vouchsafing him a glance.</p>

<p>Drake then left them to find out the time when the
case would be heard, and they reached the court just before
twelve o’clock. Curious glances were thrown at
them as they entered, and soon it became known that
Gaunt’s wife was present. Lady Mildred’s face was devoid
of expression, but under the insistent staring she
grew nervous, so that at last she let fall a thick veil
which effectually concealed her features. However, her
purpose had been accomplished, for it would be reported
in the papers that she was present.</p>

<p>It was not until her husband stood in the dock that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
she really realized that he was a prisoner, and she
clutched tightly at her sister’s hand.</p>

<p>If they should find him guilty?</p>

<p>The mere thought caused her heart to throb madly,
and when she caught sight of the Baron’s smiling face,
she could have cried out in her agony. But soon her
attention became concentrated upon counsel’s speech,
and she followed his words with an eagerness that was
painful.</p>

<p>And then there came the description of the crime
with which Gaunt was accused. A quiet gasp escaped
her as she understood the meaning of what had been
said. John—her husband—had robbed a white man
of his wife—a native woman—and then had shot the
man whom he had robbed. Her husband accused of
such baseness! It was incredible! But was it possible
that these people could bring such a charge unless there
were some foundation for it? An intense jealousy seized
her in its grip and she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“Come, Ethel,” she whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>Drake, too, rose to accompany them, but she waved
him back.</p>

<p>“I wish to go alone with my sister. Stay here,” she
gasped, and he obeyed her.</p>

<p>The car was outside and Lady Mildred entered and
threw herself back against the cushions.</p>

<p>“Tell him—to drive—home quickly,” she said to
her sister, and the words were uttered with great difficulty.</p>

<p>The car started off and Lady Ethel drew down the
blinds, for her sister was crying piteously, and tears were
streaming down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it is untrue,” Lady Ethel whispered.</p>

<p>“But the disgrace of it. I hate him. I will never
willingly see John again,” Lady Mildred cried vehemently.</p>

<p>When she reached home she went at once to her
room, and threw herself on the bed, while great sobs
shook her. Although she knew it not, the wound was
to her pride—that the man she loved, the man whose
wife she was, should have his name coupled with a native
woman; and a great anger against him mastered her.
Honestly she believed that an end had come to her love,
and now she almost hoped that he would remain in
prison. At last her sobs ceased and she formed a determination
as she bathed her face. Her maid was summoned
and received orders to pack at once for a long
visit.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel came in and gave a cry of surprise when
she saw the preparations that were being made.</p>

<p>“You are going away?” she said with great distress.</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you think I can stay under the same roof
as my husband after what has passed? Is it necessary
to explain?” she asked wearily.</p>

<p>“No, dear; but won’t you take a little time for consideration?”
Lady Ethel said anxiously.</p>

<p>“I am leaving here at once. Will you come with
me?” Lady Mildred cried impetuously.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall, but I think you ought to give your
husband a chance of explaining.”</p>

<p>“I wish never to see him again. I hate him.”</p>

<p>Orders had already been given that the large car
should be got ready, and when directions had been given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
for the forwarding of their luggage, Lady Mildred led
the way to the hall.</p>

<p>“Surely you will write to John,” Lady Ethel suggested
diffidently.</p>

<p>“Yes—I will.” And Lady Mildred crossed to the
table on which there was a box of stationery.</p>

<p>“<em>To my dying day I shall regret that I am your
wife</em>,” she wrote and sealed the envelope and handed it
to a footman.</p>

<p>They entered the car and the nurse sat facing them
with the baby in her arms, but the little one resented being
disturbed in his morning’s sleep.</p>

<p>“Let me have him,” Lady Ethel said quietly.</p>

<p>But her sister was staring through the window, a
great misery in her eyes, but wounded pride can even
drive away love.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">John Gaunt</span> once again read his wife’s letter with
its message: “<em>To my dying day I shall regret
that I am your wife</em>,” and the words burnt themselves
into his brain. Drake was standing near but
spoke no word for he could read tragedy on the face
of his friend, and realized that sympathy would be of no
help.</p>

<p>“Now I am with you heart and soul. The Baron is
responsible for this, and the Baron and his friends shall
pay me. Read that,” Gaunt said and passed the letter
to Drake. The latter took it hesitatingly, and glanced
at the two lines.</p>

<p>“You must not attach too much importance to this,”
he said earnestly. “Your wife was upset and already
she will have regretted such a message. You must remember
that Ruggles’ speech must have sounded horrible
to a woman’s ear. Your wife listened to an accusation
that you had robbed a man of his native mistress
and then had deliberately shot the man that you had
robbed. I believe it is not the truth of the charge that
has distressed her but the fact that such a charge has been
made. She loves you, and her respect for you will have
been shattered, her pride in you will have received a
grievous wound, and her instinct was to strike back.
She knew that the easiest way of making you suffer
would be through your love for her—hence this letter.”</p>

<p>“You may be right, but I do not care. She has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
left my house, taking my child with her, and I swear
that I will never try to bring her back,” Gaunt cried
recklessly.</p>

<p>“You, too, are upset, or you would not say those
words. It was in the same mood that your wife wrote
to you. I have no doubt that she will be back to-night.
You may be sure that she will read Sir Richard’s
speech, and will feel ashamed of having acted so
hastily.”</p>

<p>There was misery in Gaunt’s eyes, but with a supreme
effort he pulled himself together, and going
over to the writing-table produced a bundle of papers
from a drawer.</p>

<p>“Drake, I shall be glad if you will not again refer to
Lady Mildred. You will doubtless be glad that henceforth
I shall be able to concentrate my energies on our
scheme. We have so far been particularly fortunate,
and unless something unforeseen happens, the expedition
ought to start within a fortnight. By the bye, what
about Alvarez?”</p>

<p>“He is waiting to hear from me. If you wish, I
could arrange an appointment for to-night. He appears
very anxious to come to an arrangement, for San Salvador
badly needs the money.”</p>

<p>“Fix up the appointment; the sooner it is settled the
better.”</p>

<p>“My brother has asked Captain Armstrong to dinner.
The invitation was given before he knew of your arrest.
I presume you would like him to come?”</p>

<p>“Who is Captain Armstrong?”</p>

<p>“I think he is the very man we want. Until a year
ago he was a commander in the navy, but he had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
leave the service owing to a serious injury to his knee.
He was a very capable officer, and would be an ideal
commander of our war-ship. Of course, he has been told
nothing of the nature of the expedition, but I should
imagine that it is just the thing that would appeal to
him. At one time he was in command of the <em>Thistle</em>, a
gunboat on the west coast of Africa, and he knows
every inch of the coast. It was there that my brother
first met him.”</p>

<p>“Good; I shall be glad to meet the captain. Fix up
the appointment with Alvarez for ten o’clock. By that
time, we may have come to an arrangement with Armstrong,
and he will be useful at the interview.”</p>

<p>“I will go and telephone,” Drake answered, but he did
not move at once, and Gaunt was conscious that he was
being regarded with deep sympathy.</p>

<p>“Well? What is it?” the latter cried irritably.</p>

<p>“I should like to say how sorry I am that this has
happened. It was diabolical of the Baron to have
caused such a lying story to be told in court.”</p>

<p>“The Baron will be repaid. His pocket shall suffer,
and he will feel that more than any other punishment.”</p>

<p>Alone, Gaunt stared moodily before him, and sat
motionless for a long time. His pride was hurt that his
wife should write him such a letter, and in his anger he
could not make allowances for her. And yet it was but
a few hours ago that they had been supremely happy,
and it was difficult to realize that she had left him. But
there was much to be done, and in work he would seek
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>For a long time he struggled with himself, and when
at last he went up-stairs to dress for dinner, all traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
distress had left his face. His manner was calm and collected
as he greeted Captain Armstrong, and the two
men were attracted by one another at the outset. In appearance
the latter was the typical naval officer, a man
of few words, but thoroughly efficient.</p>

<p>It was not until they were smoking their cigars in the
library that Gaunt broached the subject.</p>

<p>“I want you to treat my proposal as a confidence,” he
began.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>And Gaunt proceeded to outline the scheme, to which
Captain Armstrong listened with close attention, and it
was noticeable that he asked no questions until the millionaire
lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>“I do not propose to understand your motive, but I assume
that it is a philanthropic one,” Armstrong said quietly.</p>

<p>“You are right in your assumption,” Drake broke in
quickly.</p>

<p>“Philanthropy coupled with a desire for revenge,”
Gaunt added drily.</p>

<p>“I can better understand the latter. Of course, your
plan is a dangerous one.”</p>

<p>“Is it feasible? That is more to the point,” Gaunt
interrupted.</p>

<p>“I can see no reason why it shouldn’t succeed. As a
matter of fact I was up on the Tyne a few weeks ago and
saw the San Salvador cruiser. She is capable of doing
all the work you would require, for the Congo defenses
are not very strong.” The captain paused a moment and
then continued gravely: “Yes, I am of opinion that we
could safely ‘hold up’ the Congo; that is, until some
European power sent war-ships to crush us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“You use the word ‘we,’” Gaunt remarked significantly.</p>

<p>“Intentionally, sir, for I should like to join you. The
Admiralty has no further need of my services, and thinks
that my groggy knee makes me useless. As a matter of
fact I believe that I am as capable of good work in the
navy as ever I was. The last twelve months have been
a terrible nightmare to me. I have found myself wandering
from Devonport to Portsmouth, from Portsmouth
to Chatham, and I have been utterly miserable. The
service was life to me, and I am only too glad to get
back to harness, even if it is to engage in what practically
amounts to a piratical expedition. We certainly
ought to see some fun,” the captain wound up, and there
was a merry twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“We shall be all right for men below deck, engineers
and mechanics, but we are rather short of trained gunners,”
Lindsay Drake said, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>“I dare say I can put my hand on a few men. Please
tell me exactly how far you have gone, and then we can
make our arrangements,” Armstrong said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Shall we first settle your position, captain? You will
be in command of the cruiser to all intents and purposes,
but of course, my say in the policy will be the final one,”
Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>“That is only reasonable. You will find me a loyal
pirate.”</p>

<p>Edward Drake rose to his feet, and his face was deeply
flushed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt said that revenge was part of his motive,
but I must tell you that the idea originated with one
motive, and only one; namely, to free a nation that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
being cruelly tortured, and done to death. I hope that I
am a Christian and my conscience tells me that I am
doing right in joining this expedition. Every other
means has failed, and it is only as a last resource that
we are about to use force,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I appreciate and respect your motive, Mr. Drake.
More than that, I understand it. But I will be equally
frank. I have agreed to join you for the fun and sport
of the thing. You must take me on those terms, or not
at all,” Armstrong answered with an engaging smile.</p>

<p>“Drake, we won’t discuss the expedition from an ethical
point of view. Captain, I am glad to have met you,
for I think that you are the man we want. There is
only one other matter to settle—the question of salary,”
Gaunt said with a smile.</p>

<p>“That is soon settled. I am not a poor man, and as I
said before, I come for the fun of the thing or not at all;
but stay, I don’t mind a thousand of these excellent
cigars,” Armstrong answered, as he inhaled a deep
breath.</p>

<p>And then they began to discuss details with animation
and it was arranged that Captain Armstrong should take
complete charge of all that concerned the cruiser.
While they were in the middle of the discussion Señor
Alvarez was announced, and was at once brought to the
library. The South American’s manner was of a suavity
that was oppressive, but he evidently had a keen eye to
business.</p>

<p>“The position is this,” Gaunt said bluntly. “You
haven’t enough money to complete the purchase of the
cruiser. As a matter of fact, I know that you won’t require
the war-ship for at least six months, for you won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
be ready till then to deal with your troublesome neighbor.
I am willing to pay the balance of a hundred
thousand pounds to the builders and you can formally
take over the cruiser. You will have as crew our men,
and Captain Armstrong will meet you at an agreed
place. In consideration of my having made the payment,
you will lease the cruiser to us for six months.”</p>

<p>“I do not know the purpose for which you require the
ship,” Alvarez said, “and how shall we stand if you fail
to deliver her to me at the end of six months?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to enter into a bond to pay for the full
value of the ship should I fail to deliver her,” Gaunt replied.</p>

<p>“And you will not tell me to what use the cruiser will
be put?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary for you to know, señor, but I may
say that I am willing to give you a check for twenty
thousand pounds of which you may make any use you
wish,” Gaunt said significantly.</p>

<p>This bribe closed the matter, and it was arranged that
the check should be dated a month hence.</p>

<p>“I take that precaution, señor, and I tell you plainly
that if you talk to any one of our little arrangement, the
check will be stopped. I require secrecy,” Gaunt said
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Which I will gladly give—at such a price,” Alvarez
added under his breath.</p>

<p>After the South American had left, the discussion was
resumed, and it was late when the party broke up.</p>

<p>“You think that we can be ready in a fortnight?”
Gaunt asked of Armstrong.</p>

<p>“Yes. I shall go to Newcastle in the morning. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
shall let it be understood that I have entered the service
of San Salvador, and Alvarez must back me up. If he
does so, I can go on working without arousing any suspicion,”
the latter answered.</p>

<p>“That is an excellent idea. You must not come to
my house again. Captain Drake had better take up his
quarters at an hotel, and you can communicate with him.
I shall not be surprised if the Baron keeps a pretty close
watch on my movements,” the millionaire remarked.</p>

<p>When Drake and Gaunt were alone, neither of them
showed any inclination for bed. The former was silent
for a while, for he was trying to devise a means of reconciling
Lady Mildred to her husband, while Gaunt was
thinking of his wife.</p>

<p>“I am sure that Lady Ethel will be your friend. She
will do all that she can to bring her sister back,” Drake
said suddenly.</p>

<p>“You believe that?” Gaunt answered incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, for she will know that Lady Mildred’s happiness
will lie in you. I sometimes think that you do not do
justice to your sister-in-law. She is not the frivolous
woman you imagine her to be.”</p>

<p>“I fear that you are prejudiced in her favor.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Drake hurriedly.</p>

<p>Gaunt held out his hand and a smile flitted across his
face.</p>

<p>“My friend, I am not blind, and I wish you more luck
than I have had,” he said quietly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lady Mildred’s</span> destination was the family
dower house, the use of which her brother had
given her as a country retreat. It was several
hours’ drive from London, and they were all tired out by
the time that they arrived. During the journey the
sisters spoke very seldom, and it was not until they had
dined that any serious conversation took place. Then it
was Lady Ethel who broached the subject.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will write to John to-night and tell
him where you are?” she began nervously.</p>

<p>“No,” was the uncompromising answer.</p>

<p>“I won’t presume to advise you, Mildred, but he will
be very anxious, and after all you are judging him without
hearing his side,” Lady Ethel answered with quiet
persistence.</p>

<p>“I refuse to discuss it with you. Now I am going to
bed, for I am tired,” Lady Mildred said coldly and
immediately she left the room.</p>

<p>But alone, her composure vanished, and she threw
herself on to the bed, sobbing bitterly, and it was many
hours before she fell asleep, worn out in mind and body.
When morning came she was once more calm, and her
manner was cold and forbidding when she met her sister.</p>

<p>“I absolutely refuse to discuss my husband with you,”
she said to her, “and if you persist in doing so, you must
leave here.”</p>

<p>“It is for your own good, Mildred, for I hate to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
you spoiling your life. Read this morning’s paper and
you will see that John’s counsel denied that John took
away the native woman from the man he shot except to
save her torture. You will say that John was quite right
in shooting the brute who could torture a woman in the
way Marillier did. Don’t you see that this charge is
only trumped up by the Baron to force John to silence?
If I were in your place, I would be by my husband’s side,
and help him to defeat his enemy,” Lady Ethel cried
vehemently.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred had seized the newspaper and was
eagerly reading the full account given of the proceedings
at Bow Street.</p>

<p>A perusal of Sir Richard’s speech made her doubt for
the first time that she had acted wisely in leaving her
husband. But pride quickly banished the doubt, for she
could imagine her friends commenting on the charge.</p>

<p>“It is an easy matter to deny its truth, for John could
do nothing else,” she told herself.</p>

<p>It was not merely this accusation that distressed her
for there was also the fact that all this scandal might have
been avoided by his giving a simple promise to the Baron.
And he had refused to do this, even when she had
appealed to him so passionately.</p>

<p>The days passed slowly, and as each morning came,
Lady Ethel hoped that her sister would have relented,
but there was no sign of any change; so, when a week
had gone, she rose early and drove straight to London,
without leaving word where she had gone. It was twelve
o’clock when she reached Park Lane, only to find that
there was no one in the house except the servants.
However, she decided to wait Gaunt’s return, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
went to her room to prepare for lunch. As she passed
her brother-in-law’s room she chanced to glance through
the open door, and to her surprise noticed many trunks
lying around, all of which were strapped.</p>

<p>“Can he be going away?” she asked herself.</p>

<p>There was too much luggage for a short visit, so it was
evident that a long journey was contemplated, and she
determined not to leave London until she had found out
where John was going. When she went down-stairs
again she heard the sound of voices in the library and so
entered.</p>

<p>Gaunt and Edward Drake were talking earnestly together,
and they stopped when they saw her.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” she said brightly.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” Drake replied curtly.</p>

<p>“John, I have just left Mildred. I want you to come
back with me to see her,” she said earnestly.</p>

<p>“Did she send you to me? Have you any message?”
he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“No. Mildred has not been very well, and I am sure
if you saw her, everything would come right. I have
seen that your trunks are packed, and I fear that you are
going to do something stupid.”</p>

<p>“My wife will have to come to me, after what has
happened,” Gaunt answered sternly.</p>

<p>“John, don’t let any silly pride ruin your happiness.
After all, Mildred has some cause for complaint.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to discuss it,” he answered with a harsh
laugh, and strode from the room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, won’t you help me?” she said and her
hands were outstretched towards him in appeal.</p>

<p>In a moment he had clasped them, and their eyes met—his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
filled with love as he struggled to keep back the
passionate words that came near his lips.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing. Mr. Gaunt will not be influenced,
for he is deeply hurt, and rightly so, I think. Go back
to your sister and persuade her to come here at once.
In a few days it will be too late for——”</p>

<p>He stopped and she looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>“Is John going away? Will it be for a long time?”
she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing, for it is not my secret.”</p>

<p>“But this wretched police court case. I had forgotten
that it was to-day. What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. A little evidence which was worthless was
given, and the case was adjourned until next Thursday.
But you may assure your sister that there is no danger
to Mr. Gaunt. The worst he did was to shoot Marillier,
but it was in self-defense, and he was justified.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you. The man deserved death,” she
answered vehemently.</p>

<p>Drake suddenly realized that he was still holding her
hands—and a vivid flush came to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ethel, I love you,” he whispered passionately, for the
temptation was too great for his strength, and for the
moment he had forgotten that this was the woman whom
his brother loved.</p>

<p>She disengaged herself gently, and her eyes met his
steadily. But before she could speak the door was
thrown open and Gaunt came in.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel gave a quick sigh of relief, but her face
was flushed and she deliberately turned away from Edward
Drake.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” Gaunt asked of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come along then.”</p>

<p>Drake still hesitated, but receiving no encouragement
from Lady Ethel, he moved slowly away. She hastened
after them, however, and addressed her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“John, I am going back to Mildred. Won’t you send
her some message?”</p>

<p>“I have already answered you.”</p>

<p>“You are very cruel. You ought to make allowances
for her,” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he called to her, and slipping his arm
through Drake’s hastened away.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel realized that it was no use to stay longer,
so made preparations for her return, and was about to
enter the car that was in waiting at the door when she
heard her name called; and turning, she saw Lindsay
Drake approaching her, an eager smile on his face.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to see you. I thought I should not
have an opportunity of wishing you good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You are going away?” she said quickly, and then
gave him a curious look. “Come with me a little way.
Mr. Gaunt and your brother have just gone out,” she
added.</p>

<p>“I ought to see them at once,” he answered doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Surely you can spare half an hour?”</p>

<p>Her manner was so gracious that he could not withstand
the temptation.</p>

<p>“I must not be late,” he remarked, and jumped up beside
her and the car started off immediately.</p>

<p>“Are you going abroad?” she asked casually.</p>

<p>“To West Africa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“Surely your leave is not up? You have only just
come home. May I ask if you are going alone?”</p>

<p>“I would much rather not talk about myself,” he answered
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Then let us talk of Mr. Gaunt. Is he accompanying
you to West Africa?”</p>

<p>Captain Drake did not answer and she grew more insistent.</p>

<p>“And is your destination the Congo?” she persisted.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was intuition coupled with her woman’s wit
that made her ask the question. There was the fact that
Gaunt was evidently making preparations for a long absence;
and she remembered the determined way in
which he was fighting for the cause of the Congo natives.
Now there was Captain Drake’s hurried departure and when
she saw his hesitation her conjecture seemed to be verified.</p>

<p>“So Mr. Gaunt is going with you to the Congo?” she
insisted.</p>

<p>“I wish you would not ask me these questions, Lady
Ethel. I hate to refuse you but already I have been indiscreet.
I would willingly tell you everything but in
honor I am bound to silence,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>“You have answered me, and I wish to know what it
means. You must be aware that my sister and Mr.
Gaunt have quarreled, and if he goes away for a long
time, their estrangement may be forever. It is this mystery
which is the cause of everything. Tell me the reason
that compelled Mr. Gaunt to force this scandal upon
us. He did force it, for at a word from him the whole
thing would have subsided. If only my sister knew his
motive, I believe that she would go to him and ask for
forgiveness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>Captain Drake was moved, for he could see that she
was greatly disturbed, and for the moment he was
tempted to tell her everything. But the temptation was
thrust aside, and his face became stern.</p>

<p>“I can only say that his motive does him honor,” he
said steadily.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a cry for he chanced to look
through the window and saw that they had reached the
country. He had been so deeply interested in his
companion that all knowledge of time and place had left
him, but now he realized that he would be late for his
appointment.</p>

<p>“Where are we?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I really do not know,” she answered with indifference.</p>

<p>“I must get back to London at once. Please order
the chauffeur to return.”</p>

<p>“You will not do what I ask; then why should I help
you?” she said with a touch of malice.</p>

<p>In an instant he had moved the indicator, the car
came to a standstill, and he jumped to the ground.</p>

<p>“How far are we from a railway station?” Drake
demanded curtly from the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Two or three miles, sir,” the chauffeur replied.</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, come back into the car,” Lady Ethel
said in a low voice; and when she saw that he hesitated,
added to the chauffeur: “Drive back towards London,
but stop when we meet a taxi-cab.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Drake said gratefully, and once more
sat down beside her.</p>

<p>For a time neither of them spoke but he was conscious
that every now and then she threw him a quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
glance from beneath her lashes. His eyes were turned
steadily towards the passing scenery, for he dared not
look at her.</p>

<p>“Captain Drake, I am sorry. It was a mean trick,”
she began nervously.</p>

<p>In an instant his hand had covered hers, pressing it
convulsively.</p>

<p>“Lady Ethel, I shall not see you again for a long
time, and this is my good-bye. I want you to know
that I love you. Don’t answer me, for I know that I
have nothing to offer. I am a poor soldier, and——”
he broke off, for his voice shook. “But I couldn’t go
away without letting you know of my love.”</p>

<p>Her face had grown white and she did not answer, but
he did not see that her eyes were dim, and her face sad.</p>

<p>Suddenly the brakes were put on, the car slowed
down, and the chauffeur signaled to an approaching
taxi-cab driver.</p>

<p>“Good-bye—won’t you wish me good luck?” Drake
said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and I hope that you will all come back
safely. I am sorry, very sorry. Please tell your brother
that—but no, I won’t send my message. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>And she watched him drive away.</p>

<p>“Where to, my lady?” the chauffeur asked respectfully.</p>

<p>“Home.”</p>

<p>“Park Lane, my lady?”</p>

<p>“No. To Lynton House,” she answered.</p>

<p>The car started and Lady Ethel drew down the blinds
for she was crying quietly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Baron de Croiseuil heard the magistrate’s
decision that bail should be granted to
Gaunt, his indignation was intense, for both
his solicitor and Mr. Ruggles, K. C., had advised him
that such an eventuality need not be considered. Immediately
the case was over, he hastened back to his
hotel where he was soon joined by Sherren, who had
been in attendance at the court.</p>

<p>“English magistrates are fools,” the Baron cried
angrily by way of greeting, and Sherren did not dissent
from this stricture on the bench.</p>

<p>“What is your next move?” the latter asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t yet considered it, for I had counted upon
Gaunt being put safely out of the way for a time.
What about the Amanti case?”</p>

<p>“Weiss is in a furious rage that his name had been
mentioned, and when I saw him last night, he made all
sorts of threats.”</p>

<p>“Never mind Weiss. He doesn’t count. Do you
think your friend of the Amanti Company would bring
Gaunt into the case? I understand that counsel is of
opinion that he could be got at on a charge of conspiracy?”</p>

<p>“That is true, Baron, but that would necessitate
Weiss also being charged.”</p>

<p>“I said that Weiss didn’t count, and if necessary he’ll
have to suffer with the others,” De Croiseuil said impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to wait till the adjourned hearing
of Gaunt’s case? If you can only manage to get
some strong evidence from Brussels, the magistrate
would refuse to grant bail.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible, for there’s no evidence to be
got.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the first time that evidence had been
manufactured,” Sherren suggested.</p>

<p>“True, but I don’t like your English courts of justice.
Now, if the trial were only taking place in the
Congo——”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders expressively, and lapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>“I think we had better wait developments,” he said at
last. “You can go, Sherren, for you will have plenty of
work to do. See that the case is reported as fully as
possible from our point of view,” he added significantly.</p>

<p>“I shall have some difficulty in working the papers.
Sir Richard Tester is a man who carries a good deal of
weight, and he did not mince matters to-day. It is
probable that the more influential journals will regard
the case as an attempt to close Gaunt’s mouth, and as I
have already told you, our press is not easily handled.
Besides, newspapers may not comment upon a case
which is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub judice</i>.”</p>

<p>“You think that the bringing of the case was a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, inasmuch as bail was granted. Gaunt’s meetings
will be packed and now the British public will look
upon him as something of a martyr.”</p>

<p>“You must persuade your Amanti friends to prosecute
him. They can’t say that I have a hand in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
that and the two cases together may make some impression.”</p>

<p>“It might be done, but Gaunt is a powerful man, and
my friend might not like the task of fighting him,” Sherren
said slowly.</p>

<p>“What kind of a man is he—as unscrupulous as
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Baron, but there is no need to insult
me.”</p>

<p>“Can you bribe him?” the Baron asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“He might be prepared to accept a pecuniary inducement,”
Sherren answered cautiously.</p>

<p>“Sound him, and let me know the result. Now you
can go.”</p>

<p>It was but seldom that the Baron’s manner lost the
suavity but he was upset for he realized that he had been
guilty of an unforgivable sin—an error in tactics. However,
the events of the next few days reassured him
somewhat, for Gaunt made no sign. In fact several
meetings on the Congo question had been canceled and
he began to grow rather uneasy.</p>

<p>“Have I frightened him?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>But instinct told him that Gaunt was not the man to
be beaten so easily and he wondered what was to be the
next move. He had seen Lady Mildred leave the court
during the trial, and had ascertained that she had gone to
Lynton House. Therefore it was natural to suppose that
husband and wife had quarreled, and he realized that
Gaunt must be greatly embittered by the false story that
he had put forward. To add to the Baron’s discomfort,
the authorities in Belgium were very displeased with what
had happened, and their letters had expressed their opinions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
very forcibly. The Baron, for the first time, was
glad that his late master was dead for King Leopold
would have shown him no mercy.</p>

<p>However, witnesses were sent over from Brussels, and
amongst them was the official who had made inquiries
into Marillier’s death. This gentleman’s name was M.
Bouvais and his instructions were to proceed to the
Baron’s hotel.</p>

<p>“You are prepared to give evidence?” De Croiseuil
asked curtly in French.</p>

<p>“Certainly, your Excellency, but I speak very little
English.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. But, stay, I will translate to
you what our counsel, M. Ruggles—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon dieu</i> what a
name!—what the counsel said at the court.”</p>

<p>Bouvais listened attentively, and his face was expressive
of blank amazement.</p>

<p>“Now you know what your evidence will be. It
is not difficult to remember,” the Baron wound up cheerfully.</p>

<p>“But it is not the truth. I examined the facts and
judged that Gaunt was justified in shooting Marillier.
The man was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i>,” Bouvais said quietly.</p>

<p>“You must forget that and only remember what I have
just read,” the Baron rejoined suavely.</p>

<p>“I fear that I do not understand your Excellency. As
a man of honor I must tell the truth,” Bouvais said with
quiet dignity.</p>

<p>“The exigencies of the service demand a little sacrifice.
It is essential that Gaunt is confined in prison. Remember
what is at stake, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“My honor is at stake and I remember that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, mon cher Bouvais. We have a
way of handsomely rewarding those who are zealous for
our interests. If I remember your record, you were not
quite so scrupulous in the Congo. As a minor official
you got more than your quantum of rubber, and there
were a few incidents in the collecting of it. There was
the massacre of one village about which the missionaries
made an outcry. They demanded your trial, and we protected
you. It was not so very long ago that you were in
charge of a district. Of course we denied that you were
guilty of atrocities, but how many natives were killed
when that chief rebelled? You wiped out many villages
and——”</p>

<p>“They were only natives, and I did as I had been ordered.
I did as my brother officials have done and are
doing,” Bouvais answered warmly.</p>

<p>“And yet you will not consent to give this evidence
against Gaunt?”</p>

<p>“No. He is a white man, and I liked him,” was the
decisive reply.</p>

<p>“Ah, Bouvais, your answer pains me, for I fear that
we shall cease to be friends. You are drawing a pension,
and we cannot continue to pay one who will not go out
of his way to help us.”</p>

<p>“The pension is a small one and I am not a poor
man.”</p>

<p>“And all your wealth you have got through us. This
is your gratitude to those who gave you the chance of
becoming a rich man. But you cannot be serious.
Consider, my friend. You are rich and we can add to
your riches; upon my recommendation you will receive
honors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“But in receiving honors I shall lose my own. I cannot
do this thing, and nothing you can say will make me
change my decision.”</p>

<p>The Baron was a keen judge of human nature, and
knew when he was beaten, so he made no further effort
to persuade Bouvais.</p>

<p>“You can go back to Brussels. I will report upon
your disobedience,” he said coldly.</p>

<p>Bouvais bowed slightly, and without another word
left the room. He was like dozens of his fellow-countrymen,
who think nothing of killing off and torturing
a native, yet would hesitate to commit deliberate
perjury.</p>

<p>The Baron was thoroughly irritated by his lack of
success, and, for a while, paced restlessly up and down
the room until he was interrupted by the entrance of a
waiter.</p>

<p>“Mr. Weiss is here, sir.”</p>

<p>“I cannot see him. Say that I am engaged,” the
Baron said impatiently.</p>

<p>“I rather expected that, so I took the precaution
of coming up,” Weiss said from the doorway, and
strolled in.</p>

<p>There was a glitter of anger in his eyes, but his manner
was very calm and collected.</p>

<p>“What explanation have you to give me of your dastardly
conduct?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I do not understand. Have you any cause for complaint?”
the Baron asked quickly.</p>

<p>“You know that you have betrayed me. It was your
tool Sherren who caused Davies to be prosecuted, and it
was you who caused my name to be mentioned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“Why should I do that, Mr. Weiss?”</p>

<p>“Because you wish to get at Gaunt. I came to you
as a friend, and I trusted you. In return you have made
my name a byword.”</p>

<p>“I deny it. I have had nothing to do with the matter,”
the Baron said calmly.</p>

<p>“And Sherren?”</p>

<p>“He had nothing to do with it—to my knowledge.
I am surprised that you can accuse me of such dishonorable
conduct.”</p>

<p>“I happen to know that Sherren was the moving
spirit. I am not a fool, Baron, and understand that you
found it necessary to sacrifice me. You deny it—well—we
will leave it at that for the moment. Good-day,
Baron. I think that you will find me a dangerous
enemy,” Weiss said menacingly and took his departure.</p>

<p>And the Baron resumed his restless walk, but he was
disturbed by the Jew’s threats, for he knew the man to
be powerful. However, he comforted himself with the
thought that Weiss could do very little to injure him.
Any exposure of the part he (the Baron) had played
would naturally call attention to Weiss’ own guilt.</p>

<p>The Baron was present at the adjourned hearing
against Gaunt, and to his dismay, the magistrate was
not in the least sympathetic. In fact he commented
severely upon the evidence that was brought forward,
and when he adjourned the court made some significant
remarks to Mr. Ruggles.</p>

<p>“I am very dissatisfied with this case. It seems to
me that it has been brought recklessly, and without sufficient
evidence.”</p>

<p>“My material witnesses were in the Congo but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
are now on the way to this country,” Mr. Ruggles intervened.</p>

<p>“Until their arrival, I will say no more.”</p>

<p>“There is further evidence that I can produce in a
week’s time,” Mr. Ruggles urged.</p>

<p>“Then I will adjourn the case till then. The prisoner
will be released on the same bail.”</p>

<p>“I am instructed that there is a grave suspicion that
the prisoner intends to leave the country, and I strongly
urge that your Worship will refuse to grant bail.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if my learned friend has any evidence to
back up that suggestion?” Sir Richard Tester asked
quietly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ruggles made no answer.</p>

<p>“The insinuation is in keeping with the rest of the
case—groundless,” Sir Richard continued.</p>

<p>“The bail will be as before,” the magistrate announced
abruptly.</p>

<p>And John Gaunt, who stood in the dock, drew a deep
breath of relief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Lady Mildred was told that her sister
had gone away in the motor-car without
leaving any message, she at once jumped to
the conclusion that her journey was to London. She
had been aware that Lady Ethel had been very anxious,
and it was natural to think that she might go to see John
Gaunt with the idea of affecting a reconciliation between
herself and her husband.</p>

<p>The week’s solitude had somewhat softened her feelings,
but there still remained some bitterness. And perhaps,
too, jealousy that Gaunt would not make a sacrifice
to retain her love.</p>

<p>But when the afternoon came to an end, she began to
wait with impatience her sister’s return, and her restlessness
increased with each passing hour. When at last the
sound of the car could be heard she ran eagerly to meet
her.</p>

<p>“Where have you been? Why did you not tell me
you were going?” she demanded impetuously.</p>

<p>Lady Ethel smiled a little wanly as she threw off her
furs.</p>

<p>“I have been to London. But let us go to your
room, dear.”</p>

<p>The sisters did not speak again until they were alone
and there was great anxiety in Lady Mildred’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I have seen your husband.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me at once. Why do you hesitate?” Lady
Mildred cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to explain what happened. It was as I
thought. Your letter has wounded him deeply, and I
am afraid that you must go to him, if you wish to be
forgiven.”</p>

<p>“Forgiveness!” Lady Mildred repeated scornfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. You, I think, are in the wrong. If you take
my advice you will order the car and go to London at
once. You would get there by ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Why should I go to him? It is I who have been
wronged, and he must come to me.”</p>

<p>“If that is your state of mind, then I fear that you
will remain apart. It is a pity, for I am convinced that
you are both passionately in love with one another.
Pride is responsible for the ruin of many lives, and I
pray you not to be stupid, dear,” Lady Ethel said gently.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred was silent, and it was evident that she
was struggling with herself. It was strange to find that
her sister’s sympathy was so decidedly in favor of her
husband, and she began to wonder if, after all, she herself
might be to blame. But the scene in court came
back to her mind, and she could hear the counsel’s words
as he described the charge against Gaunt.</p>

<p>And while she fought with her pride, she was conscious
that her love for John Gaunt was burning fiercely, and
that if he were to appear she would receive him with
widely opened arms.</p>

<p>“I went to Park Lane, and no one was there,” Lady
Ethel continued quietly. “I chanced to pass your husband’s
room and I saw many trunks there, so I imagine
that he is going away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>Lady Mildred drew a quick breath, and a look of fear
crept into her eyes when she remembered the talk in the
library.</p>

<p>Could John be going to the Congo? Was it possible
that they were about to carry out the mad scheme that
they discussed?</p>

<p>“Ethel, you must come back with me,” she cried
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I am very tired, but I will gladly come,” Lady
Ethel answered, and all the listlessness vanished in an
instant.</p>

<p>“Give orders for the car, and I will see about the
packing. Baby will stay here with nurse.”</p>

<p>“You are going to John?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes. I have been a fool, and I see it for the
first time. You are right, Ethel. There is only one
thing that matters.”</p>

<p>“Love,” Lady Ethel repeated softly, and the color
came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the sisters were driving back to
London, and the chauffeur had received instructions to
travel as quickly as possible. Now and then the car
swayed ominously, but neither of them noticed the tremendous
rate at which they were going. Lady Mildred
began to tell of Gaunt’s plans to hold up the Congo Free
State, and her story was listened to with intense eagerness.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Drake going?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, and his brother. It is a curious business for a
parson to join in.”</p>

<p>“Mildred, I warn you to prepare yourself for a disappointment
if you think that you will be able to persuade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
your husband to back out of it. He loves you passionately;
but there are some things that have more weight
with him than love.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will go, if I can only see him,” Lady
Mildred answered confidently.</p>

<p>The conversation languished and they were both relieved
when at last the car stopped at their house in
Park Lane.</p>

<p>“Is your master in?” Lady Mildred demanded of the
footman.</p>

<p>“No, my lady. He left a couple of hours ago,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>She entered quickly and ran up to her room in the
hope that there might be a letter for her, but there was
nothing there.</p>

<p>“I will ask the servants if there is any message. You
had better rest quietly; you look ill,” Lady Ethel said
and hastened away.</p>

<p>She returned in a few minutes, and her face was grave
as she sat down by her sister.</p>

<p>“He has gone, and has left no message at all. I have
been to his rooms, and the trunks are not there,” she announced.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” Lady Mildred asked hoarsely.
“Do you think that he can already have started?”</p>

<p>“No, but we must be very careful what we say. We
must be loyal to John, and we must not arouse any
suspicion among the servants.”</p>

<p>“It is nearly eleven o’clock—too late to do anything
to-night,” Lady Mildred said miserably.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and Lord Lynton came
in hurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“Have you any idea where Gaunt is?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. Haven’t you seen him?”</p>

<p>“I have been dining with Sir Keith Hamilton, and
afterwards he talked to me very plainly. It appears that
he has formed a great liking for Gaunt, and he expressed
his opinion very forcibly about this police court business.
He is convinced that Gaunt played no unworthy part in
that Marillier affair, and that the whole thing is a put up
job on the part of the Baron. I chanced to say that I
had taken up rather a strong attitude, and he promptly
told me that I was a fool, advising me to go and make
my peace at once.”</p>

<p>“And I have come on a like errand, but I am afraid
that we are too late,” Lady Mildred said brokenly, and
tears forced themselves to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Surely there ought to be no difficulty in finding
him,” the Earl said decidedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has already left the country?” Lady
Ethel broke in.</p>

<p>“No, that’s impossible, for he is on bail,” Lord Lynton
replied.</p>

<p>“Bail would not prevent him from going. I think I
ought to tell you——”</p>

<p>But Lady Mildred pulled her sister up sharply.</p>

<p>“We have no right to tell John’s secrets to any one.
Perhaps we are worrying ourselves about nothing.
There may be news in the morning,” she said hopefully,
but there was no hope in her heart.</p>

<p>The morning came and the sisters breakfasted at an
early hour. But there was no letter.</p>

<p>“Shall we call at the Carlton? Captain Drake was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
staying there,” Lady Ethel suggested, and they visited
the hotel, only to find that he, too, had left on the previous
evening.</p>

<p>“I believe that he <em>has</em> gone to the Congo,” Lady
Mildred cried vehemently when they were once more in
the car.</p>

<p>Next they visited Gaunt’s office in the city, where
they were received by Mr. Foster, the secretary, who
could give them no information.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt has ceased to come here, my lady. In a
couple of months’ time the office will be finally closed.”</p>

<p>“When did you last see Mr. Gaunt?” Lady Mildred
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, but I have no idea where he is at present.”</p>

<p>“Cannot you tell me if he is going abroad?” she
persisted.</p>

<p>“No, my lady. I have no information at all. It is
not Mr. Gaunt’s custom to tell me of his movements, unless
he thinks it necessary for me to know,” Mr. Foster
answered with a smile.</p>

<p>They returned straight to Park Lane, for that was the
most likely place at which they would receive news, but
when evening came Lady Mildred was convinced that
her suspicions were correct, and she grew utterly
despondent. It was revealed to her how great was her
love for her husband now that she believed that he had
gone deliberately into danger. All the dreadful things
that she had heard of West Africa came rushing to
her mind, and she grew desperate when she realized that
he had left her with anger in his heart. And she broke
down completely, sobbing piteously; in vain Lady Ethel
strove to comfort her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“I love him—oh, so much—and it is my fault that
we quarreled. I should have known that he would not
do so dreadful a thing as that wicked barrister charged
him with. What shall I do? I must see him,” Lady
Mildred cried passionately.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has only gone into the country for a
rest,” her sister suggested. “I don’t think that he could
have left for the Congo without saying a word.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand John. It was my lack of
trust, and that cruel, cruel letter that hurt him. What a
fool I have been.”</p>

<p>The morning came, bringing no news, and they
wandered listlessly about the house. Suddenly Lady
Ethel gave a cry, and almost fiercely clutched her sister’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Did you not say that they intended to stop at the
Canary Islands? To-day is Saturday, and the Union-Castle
Liner sails. Let us go to Waterloo and see if
John or one of the Drakes is there,” she cried impetuously.</p>

<p>The car was ordered at once, and upon arriving at the
station they found the boat train drawn up, and by the
bustle around it was evidently soon to start. They
walked eagerly along closely examining each carriage,
but saw no signs of either of them.</p>

<p>A warning whistle, and the train moved away.</p>

<p>“Of course they could join the <em>Saxon</em> at Southampton,
for John would not wish to be seen. Could
we get there in time?” Lady Mildred cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“At any rate we can try,” Lady Ethel answered
eagerly. And then began a mad race to the port. She
urged the chauffeur to full speed, and the powerful car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
tore along the road. Once or twice a policeman held
up a warning hand, but they went on heedlessly until
they reached the dock gates.</p>

<p>“Has the <em>Saxon</em> sailed?” they asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Just about starting,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Now their progress was tantalizingly slow, and when
at last the wharf came in sight, they saw that the ropes
had been thrown off and that the big liner was moving
towards Southampton water.</p>

<p>But Lady Mildred’s eyes were fixed on the upper
deck, and she could just make out the figure of a man
leaning against the rails. There were field-glasses in the
car, and with trembling fingers she focused them.</p>

<p>“It is John, and we are too late,” she said with a
gasp.</p>

<p>But she would not give way, and turned to her sister
her face white and her lips trembling.</p>

<p>“Our yacht the <em>Heron</em> is lying here. She can be
commissioned in a few days,” she said very quietly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Lady Ethel asked in
wonder.</p>

<p>“Follow them,” she answered curtly.</p>

<p>“And I will go with you,” Lady Ethel said in a low
voice, but her eyes were shining brightly.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> was a feeling of constraint when Gaunt
led Edward Drake from the room after the
latter’s interview with Lady Ethel.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I came in at a rather inopportune
moment, but this is not the time for love-making,”
Gaunt remarked kindly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were with Captain Armstrong,
who had just arrived from Newcastle to make final
arrangements.</p>

<p>“We can sail in a couple of days,” the captain
remarked cheerfully.</p>

<p>“And if we leave by the <em>Saxon</em> on Saturday, you
can pick us up at Las Palmas. With the superior speed
of the <em>Esmeralda</em> you ought to arrive about the same
time we do,” Gaunt remarked.</p>

<p>“She did twenty-five knots in her last trial,” the
captain answered complacently.</p>

<p>“You are quite satisfied with the men you have
got?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I have had to be very cautious, for there
are one or two naval men at Elswick who have been
mighty curious. I must say that Señor Alvarez has
played the game skillfully, for they all think that I have
entered the San Salvador navy. But I shall be glad
when we are outside British waters.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better get away as soon as possible.
Of course you must not come into Las Palmas harbor?”
Gaunt asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>“No, for one doesn’t generally go to South America
via the Canaries. I intend to lie a few miles off, and I
shall come ashore in the pinnace. I suppose I shall find
you at the Santa Catalina Hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Captain Drake will be with us, and he will
look after the men who are already there.”</p>

<p>They dined at the Carlton Hotel, and Captain Armstrong
was in the highest spirits, in contrast to the
others. The meal had just come to an end, and they
had lighted their cigars when Edward Drake gave a
significant look at Gaunt. The latter turned round and
saw that the Baron de Croiseuil was seating himself at a
table on the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“It is as well that he should see me here. Hang it,
I’ll go over and speak to him,” Gaunt said suddenly, and
immediately hastened across the room.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Baron,” he said suavely, and took a
chair on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>For once in his life the Baron lost his composure, and
flushed hotly.</p>

<p>“You have done your worst and have failed,” Gaunt
continued quietly.</p>

<p>“Not quite, for I have effectually closed your mouth,
my friend. It was very painful to me—the necessity of
taking these proceedings. But still, it is possible to end
them. One word, and Mr. Ruggles will explain that a
dreadful mistake has been made,” the Baron said coolly,
after a supreme effort at self-control.</p>

<p>“I do not intend to say that word. You have done
your worst. You have put forward a false charge in an
infamous way. You have attempted to ruin me utterly.
And do you think that I am the man to take it lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
down? No, my friend. It soon will be my turn,”
Gaunt said grimly.</p>

<p>“You can do nothing, and I am still willing to be
friends.”</p>

<p>“Friends!” Gaunt cried contemptuously. “Such
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i> as you, my friend! I would prefer an out and
out <em>Apache</em>. But I won’t detain you from your dinner.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</i>, Baron.”</p>

<p>And he was immediately ashamed of the outbreak,
for he had done no good save to relieve his feelings.
He did not realize that he had made the Baron thoroughly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It was decided that they should leave Gaunt House
that night and go straight to Winchester, and there await
the wire from Captain Armstrong to the effect that the
<em>Esmeralda</em> was about to sail.</p>

<p>The next day such a message came.</p>

<p>“You have still time to motor to Lynton House,”
Edward Drake suggested as they were getting ready
to start for Southampton, where they intended to stay
the night.</p>

<p>“I have told you that I won’t discuss my wife with
you,” Gaunt answered coldly.</p>

<p>“You are very hard, and I think you will regret it.
Try to put yourself in her place. She was sorely tried,”
Drake protested quietly.</p>

<p>In reply Gaunt took his wife’s letter from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Read that, and if you are a man you will understand.”</p>

<p>And Drake knew that it was hopeless to make another
effort at reconciliation. But that night was a very
miserable one for all three of them. Each was thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
of the woman that he loved, and remembering that in the
morning they sailed upon a desperate adventure from
which they might never return.</p>

<p>Passages had been booked under fictitious names,
and they went aboard the <em>Saxon</em> just before sailing
time. However, there was considerable delay, and they
knew no peace until the last rope had been thrown ashore.</p>

<p>And then Gaunt turned to Drake.</p>

<p>“We have started for good or ill,” he said with unwonted
solemnity.</p>

<p>“It is for good, and God is with us,” Edward Drake
answered reverently.</p>

<p>And then he gave a cry.</p>

<p>“There is a motor-car with two ladies.”</p>

<p>Gaunt strained his eyes towards the shore and his face
became very white when he recognized his wife. He
did not move his eyes from the place where Lady
Mildred stood, but his face did not soften. The liner
cleared the point, and began to travel more quickly,
so that in a very few minutes the wharf disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>And then he turned away with a sigh and walked to
the cabin which had been reserved for him on the deck.
There was a cold wind blowing, and he closed the door;
not till then did the mask fall from his face. Love
tugged at his heart, and he would have given all he possessed
to be face to face with his wife. His anger vanished,
never to return, and his longing for her came back
with overwhelming force. Now he blamed himself
bitterly that he had not gone to her before his departure,
for now, many weary weeks must elapse before he could
see her again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>He sat there thinking deeply—of the vow he had
made—his crusade against the rulers of the Congo—and
his wife. There was a knock at the door, and
the steward entered to unpack his trunk. Still he
did not move until the bugle sounded the hour for
dressing.</p>

<p>Almost mechanically he put on his evening clothes,
and went down to the saloon, where the passengers were
busily looking for their places at the table. Edward
Drake and his brother were already there, but the
meal was a very silent one, for each was busy with his
thoughts.</p>

<p>After dinner Gaunt and Edward Drake went to the
comfortable smoking-room on deck, and lighted their cigars.</p>

<p>“Now there can be no turning back,” Edward Drake
remarked.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to?” Gaunt demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“No. Except that I was sorry to leave England
without obtaining the answer to a question which I had
asked.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you refer to the time when I interrupted
you. I am very sorry. Drake, you are a good fellow,
and I could not wish a woman a better husband.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Drake answered simply. “At one
time I never dreamt of telling Lady Ethel of my love.
My brother Lindsay is my rival, and I thought that I
must leave the way clear to him. But love can be selfish,
and I intend to fight for my happiness. But it is
hardly credible that she can care for me.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell where a woman’s feelings are
concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“Lady Ethel was with your wife on the wharf. I am
sorry that they did not come a quarter of an hour earlier.
Lady Mildred will be very miserable.”</p>

<p>“And so will her husband. But we won’t talk of it,
Drake. I have made up my mind to think of one thing,
and one thing alone—the Congo. This may be a rash
adventure of ours, but it shall not fail from any lack of
energy on my part. And here’s luck to it,” Gaunt remarked
as he raised his glass to his lips.</p>

<p>As they steamed down the channel the weather grew
so rough that many of the passengers were confined to
their cabins. But they had determined to make no
acquaintances, and kept themselves strictly to themselves,
so they were rather glad than otherwise. Upon reaching
the bay of Biscay, as is often the case, the sea was
smoother and they were able to spend more time in the
open air. It was not until the fourth day that anything
of moment happened. It was just after twelve o’clock
that they saw smoke on the horizon, and soon they
could make out a steamer that was traveling very
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Looks like one of our small cruisers,” the first officer
remarked to them.</p>

<p>And it was not until the war-ship was but some two or
three miles astern that they knew that she was the <em>Esmeralda</em>.</p>

<p>“She is flying the San Salvador flag,” the officer
remarked.</p>

<p>Gaunt ran for his glasses, and fixed them on the vessel
of which he was the temporary owner and his heart beat
more rapidly as he noticed her workmanlike appearance.</p>

<p>“She is doing well over twenty knots, and I should say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
she carries turbines. A smart little ship,” the friendly
officer continued.</p>

<p>The <em>Esmeralda</em> was quickly overhauling them, and
soon signal flags fluttered on the <em>Saxon</em> which were
answered by the cruiser.</p>

<p>“What does she say?” Gaunt asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Only her name. She is not very communicative,
and is evidently in a hurry.”</p>

<p>The smoke was belching from her stacks and she
seemed to spurt forward so that the <em>Saxon</em> was rapidly
left behind.</p>

<p>It was late at night when they reached Las Palmas,
and they went ashore at once, to be driven along pebbly
streets to the Santa Catalina Hotel. Immediately upon
their arrival Captain Drake left to visit the men who had
already arrived and were awaiting them.</p>

<p>He ascertained from the officer who had been placed
in charge that there had been no mishap, and that they
were ready to embark at any moment.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been ordered for an early hour in the
morning, and they had not been at the table very long
before Captain Armstrong joined them.</p>

<p>“Everything all right?” asked Gaunt.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” the captain answered briskly.
“I have a good lot of men and they are shaping well.
Haven’t had trouble of any kind.”</p>

<p>“Good. Let us get breakfast over for we mustn’t stay
here a moment longer than we can help.”</p>

<p>Tugs had been chartered, and by eleven o’clock the
whole party had left the harbor. There had been many
inquiries from the officials of the port, which Captain
Armstrong had deftly turned aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>An hour later they reached the <em>Esmeralda</em>; the men
were quickly got on board and the tugs returned to Las
Palmas.</p>

<p>Gaunt and the Drakes stood on the quarter-deck and
looked around curiously. Yes. Captain Armstrong had
done wonders in the short time at his disposal.</p>

<p>Six inch guns stared at them from squat turrets, and
Edward Drake looked at Gaunt with something akin to
awe.</p>

<p>“I am beginning to realize what it means. Maybe
death, but life for the natives of the Congo,” he said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>An order from the bridge and the flag of San Salvador
was lowered. Then an ensign took its place, which was
white with a red cross.</p>

<p>“She is doing close on twenty-five knots,” Captain
Armstrong remarked as he joined them, and there was a
look of pride on his face.</p>

<p>But no one answered, and the men looked at one
another.</p>

<p>And Edward Drake sighed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Lady Mildred</span> did not enter the car until the
<em>Saxon</em> had disappeared, and to her sister’s
surprise her face was almost cheerful.</p>

<p>“Captain Samson lives in Southampton and I am
going to see him at once.”</p>

<p>“You really intend to go to the Congo?” Lady Ethel
asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and shall start as soon as possible. The <em>Heron</em>
is at Summers and Payne’s yard, and we will go there
and find out Captain Samson’s address.”</p>

<p>An hour later they were in the house of the captain
of Gaunt’s yacht, and Lady Mildred at once came to the
point.</p>

<p>“Captain, how soon can the <em>Heron</em> start on a long
voyage?” she asked.</p>

<p>“A matter of a fortnight, my lady. The engineer is
tinkering with his turbines and has got ’em to pieces,”
Captain Samson replied.</p>

<p>“What is the shortest time, working night and day?”
she insisted.</p>

<p>“It might be managed in a week, my lady,” the captain
answered reflectively.</p>

<p>“It must be quicker than that, captain. We will sail
on Friday next. Tell the steward to lay in stores for a
long voyage, and the bunkers must be filled up.”</p>

<p>“May I ask where we are going, my lady?”</p>

<p>“First of all to the Canary Islands. See the engineer
and have the work started at once. I shall be at the Station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Hotel on Thursday night, and I shall expect you
there. Good-bye, captain.”</p>

<p>And with a cheerful nod Lady Mildred left him and
gave the chauffeur orders to drive back to London.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” Lady Ethel said timidly.
“A couple of hours ago you were utterly miserable,
while now you seem almost happy.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I understand myself. I am only
thinking that in a week or two I shall see John. I have
no fear how he will receive me, for I’ve no pride left, and
I am prepared to go on my knees and ask his forgiveness
for that cruel letter,” Lady Mildred said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to come with you, dear.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I ought to take you, for we
cannot catch them up until they are in the Congo, and
there may be danger.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” Lady Ethel answered quickly.</p>

<p>During the next few days they were busy making
preparations for the voyage, and it was not until
Thursday that anything of importance happened. It
chanced that they lunched at the Carlton Hotel and
upon reaching the streets they heard the name of Gaunt
being shouted by the newspaper boys.</p>

<p>“<em>Disappearance of John Gaunt. Bail estreated.</em>”</p>

<p>And they read an account of the proceedings at the
police court. Mr. Ruggles, K. C., had been in great
form and took full advantage of the position.</p>

<p>“Listen to this,” Lady Mildred cried, and proceeded
to read from the paper. “The court was crowded this
morning at the adjourned hearing of the charge of
murder brought by the Congo government against Mr.
John Gaunt. The magistrate took his seat and the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
of the millionaire was called, but there was no answer.
At first it was believed that he had been delayed by
some accident, but when half an hour had passed, it was
murmured that he had left the country. The magistrate
adjourned the court for an hour, and when he again sat
the police gave evidence to the effect that Mr. Gaunt had
not been seen for some few days. Inquiries at his office
and at Park Lane gave no information, and it is assumed
that, for some purpose of his own, he has left the
country. Mr. Ruggles proceeded to address the court:
‘I must remind your Worship that I anticipated this
event and strongly urged that bail should not be
allowed. In spite of my urging you gave him his
freedom, of which he appears to have taken full
advantage. I apply to your Worship to grant a warrant
for his arrest.’</p>

<p>“‘Have you anything to say?’ the magistrate asked
of Sir Richard Tester.</p>

<p>“‘No, your Worship. I can only think that some
accident has happened to my client.’</p>

<p>“‘We understand the warrant has been signed and is
in the hands of the police.’”</p>

<p>“They will have to go a long way to execute it,”
Lady Mildred remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>“You do not seem very distressed,” Lady Ethel
answered drily.</p>

<p>Her answer was a laugh, and they alighted from the
car to be met by Lord Lynton, who was just coming out
of the house.</p>

<p>“I see you have heard the news,” he remarked with a
glance at the paper which she still held in her hand. “I
suppose the next we shall hear will be of his arrest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Lady Mildred answered. “Come
into the house, Geoffrey. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton followed to her room, and it was
evident that he was very curious.</p>

<p>“You have not the air of a wife who has just heard
that the police are after her husband,” he remarked drily.</p>

<p>“Geoffrey, give me your word of honor that you
will not breathe a word of what I tell you,” she said
earnestly.</p>

<p>“I can keep a secret. It is my business,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Well then, John has gone back to the Congo.
Ethel and I are going to follow him in the <em>Heron</em>.
We sail to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“The devil you are!” he blurted out.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think it would be as well if you came
with us.”</p>

<p>“You may as well tell me the whole story.”</p>

<p>“Very well, but remember that it is in confidence,”
she answered, and proceeded to relate all that had happened.</p>

<p>He listened in open-eyed amazement, and when she
had finished he had lost some of his wonted composure.</p>

<p>“It is pure madness, and the man must be stopped,”
he said hotly.</p>

<p>“Remember your promise,” she said warningly.</p>

<p>“Of course I will, but the thing is stupendous. It
may cause a European war.”</p>

<p>“Will you come with us? We need not consider
Europe. I am only thinking of my husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will come if I can get leave of absence.
When do you leave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>“We shall motor to Southampton in a couple of
hours’ time.”</p>

<p>“I will be back before that,” he answered, and
hastened away.</p>

<p>Sir Keith Hamilton did not keep him waiting very
long, and received him pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have come about your brother-in-law.
I shall not be altogether sorry if he has left the country
and doesn’t return,” Sir Keith remarked drily.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask leave of absence for an indefinite
time,” Lord Lynton answered, and his voice was very
grave.</p>

<p>“For what purpose?”</p>

<p>“To accompany my sister on her yacht.”</p>

<p>“A pleasure trip?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, sir. In fact I am bound to silence.”</p>

<p>“I see. Does this voyage concern Gaunt?”</p>

<p>“I can say that our destination is the Congo,” the
Earl announced slowly.</p>

<p>“May I ask if Gaunt will be on board?”</p>

<p>“He will not. But please don’t cross-examine me, sir.
I am in a difficult position, and I must keep my promise.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is necessary,” Sir Keith said reflectively.
“You can have your leave.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. May I ask if you have confidence in
my judgment?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to a degree,” was the cautious answer.</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing, but I would suggest that the
first cruiser squadron of the Atlantic fleet be sent to the
Canary Islands for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“That is a large order,” Sir Keith said with a smile,
but his eyes were filled with curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“The squadron is now at Gibraltar. You know I
would not suggest this without a weighty reason.
Admiral Stretton is a fine sailor, and something of a
diplomatist, I believe.”</p>

<p>The foreign secretary’s eyes did not leave the Earl’s
face, and it was a long time before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I think I may venture to say that the squadron will
cruise in the direction of the Canaries. May I understand
that you will communicate with me when you are at
liberty to do so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. At the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You can tell me nothing further?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I have not already said too much.
I am very anxious, and my responsibility is great.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if Gaunt has already gone to the Congo?”
Sir Keith said quietly.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you anticipate international trouble? I must
admit that you have made me rather anxious. Cannot
you give any further information at all?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, and a pleasant voyage. My regards
to your sister—and her husband.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton returned at once to Park Lane and sought
out his sister.</p>

<p>“Mildred, you must release me from my promise. Sir
Keith ought to know everything,” he cried impetuously.</p>

<p>“You must not tell him. It is my husband’s secret,
and if he is to fail, it shall not be through me,” she
answered firmly.</p>

<p>“But you have no idea what is at stake. This action
of Gaunt’s may precipitate a crisis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“Better that, than I should betray my husband.”</p>

<p>“I agree with Mildred,” Lady Ethel broke in quickly.</p>

<p>“You are only a child,” the Earl cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>“But I am coming with you,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p>“Upon consideration, I think it would be better that
you should both stay at home. There may be danger,
and you will be safer here,” he said firmly.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the laughter caused by his remark.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t joke, and it would be as well to understand
that you are coming as a guest on my yacht,” Lady
Mildred said coldly.</p>

<p>“You mean that you won’t obey me?” he answered
hotly.</p>

<p>“The car is ready. <em>You</em> may stay in England if you
wish. We are going,” Lady Mildred said quietly.</p>

<p>When they reached Southampton, Captain Samson
was awaiting them at the hotel with the news that the
yacht was ready for sea.</p>

<p>“Then we sail to-night,” Lady Mildred said promptly,
and their luggage was taken aboard without any delay.</p>

<p>“Less than six days’ start,” Lady Mildred told herself,
and as soon as they had left the harbor she interviewed
the captain.</p>

<p>“You are to steam at full speed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>“It is a matter of life and death. Carry out my
instructions carefully and I shall be very grateful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>And the captain returned to the bridge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sun had just risen above the horizon and
through the haze could be seen a low lying
shore which gleamed yellow in the distance.
On the quarter-deck of the <em>Esmeralda</em> stood a group of
men, and each held a pair of marine glasses to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes—that is Banana,” Captain Armstrong announced
decisively.</p>

<p>The voyage had passed without untoward incident, but
no one on board the cruiser had had an idle moment.
The men above deck had been drilled, and some practise
had been made with the guns. The leaders of the expedition
had discussed every eventuality, and the next
few days would prove whether they were to meet with success
or failure.</p>

<p>The ship was slowed down to twelve knots, and the
men were rapidly putting her into battle trim. Gaunt
and Edward Drake watched them in silence, for now they
had nothing to do save to realize that they were responsible
for what might end in disaster.</p>

<p>At last they caught a glimpse of the mouth of the
Congo, and the <em>Esmeralda</em> was turned directly towards
the entrance of the river. Captain Armstrong joined
them, and it was evident that he was in the highest
spirits.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing that I wish; that we were
flying the White Ensign,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I think that of the Church is more appropriate,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
Edward Drake answered, and glanced at the flag which
flew at the stern.</p>

<p>“Hallo! That looks like a ship in the distance,” Armstrong
cried, and hastened to the bridge.</p>

<p>The <em>Esmeralda</em> spurted ahead and entered the river
on the far side from the town of Banana.</p>

<p>“I hate being only a spectator. I wish I had something
to do,” Gaunt said irritably.</p>

<p>A few miles up the river towards Boma could be seen a
large steamer, which Gaunt at once recognized with the
aid of his glasses.</p>

<p>“It is either the <em>Albertville</em> or the <em>Leopoldville</em>,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Are they British ships?”</p>

<p>“They belong to an English firm, although they fly
the Belgian flag. There is a regular line of steamers
running from here to Antwerp, and I’ll bet that this ship
is carrying a million francs’ worth of rubber, and a like
value of ivory.”</p>

<p>“Tainted with blood,” Drake said in a low voice.
“Please God this tyranny will soon come to an end.”</p>

<p>“Now we are in for it. It’s sink or swim. See,
Armstrong is signaling them to stop,” Gaunt cried
eagerly.</p>

<p>They watched the vessel approaching, and soon answering
flags appeared.</p>

<p>“Watch for Armstrong’s reply. There it goes.
‘Heave to or we fire.’”</p>

<p>The next few minutes were breathless with excitement,
for the <em>Leopoldville</em>, for that was the name of the ship,
continued to advance; but she had slowed down perceptibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>She came nearly abreast of them but much nearer the
shore and still continued on her course.</p>

<p>Again flags fluttered from the <em>Esmeralda</em>.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp report and a shot was
fired from the cruiser. But still the <em>Leopoldville</em> did not
stop.</p>

<p>“Now comes the critical moment,” Gaunt said beneath
his breath.</p>

<p>Again the sound of a gun, and the most skillful gunner
was the firer of the shot.</p>

<p>Gaunt’s eyes were eagerly fixed on the liner.</p>

<p>“Splendid,” he cried. “It hit her right astern. Her
rudder has gone, and probably her propellers.”</p>

<p>“Will she sink?” Drake asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I should think not. The water-tight compartments
ought to keep her afloat. Even if she does go down,
there won’t be any loss of life.”</p>

<p>The <em>Leopoldville</em> gradually ceased to move, and she
lay there rolling gently with the swell. But in a few
moments they could see that a boat was being lowered,
and was rapidly rowed in the direction of the <em>Esmeralda</em>.</p>

<p>The red-faced, indignant, and greatly perplexed captain
of the <em>Leopoldville</em> ran up the companionway where
he was received by Captain Armstrong and John Gaunt.
Behind them stood Edward Drake and his brother.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this outrage? Who are
you?” he cried hotly.</p>

<p>“One question at a time, please, captain. This is a
war-ship engaged for a particular purpose, namely, the
stopping and, if necessary, sinking of all ships which
carry rubber and ivory from the Congo to Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“You are dastardly pirates,” was the angry answer.</p>

<p>“Not so, captain; for I believe pirates generally
go after spoil. Our motive is solely to help the natives
of the Congo,” Captain Armstrong answered suavely.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a parson standing there? Will you
kindly explain what it means?” the captain asked of
Edward Drake.</p>

<p>“I can tell you no more than you have already
heard,” the latter answered.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you have disabled my
ship merely with the idea of helping the natives?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, let me tell you that it is a damnably absurd
action. My ship is helpless, and it is impossible to
repair her without docking. What am I to do with my
passengers?”</p>

<p>“Take them back to Boma,” Gaunt broke in drily.</p>

<p>The captain of the <em>Leopoldville</em> turned round quickly.</p>

<p>“I know you. You’re Gaunt,” he cried.</p>

<p>“You are right. Come below and I will give you a
full explanation. You are an Englishman and we’ve no
ill feeling against you personally. It is only right that
you should know why we’ve taken such a liberty with
your ship,” Gaunt said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the captain again appeared on deck,
and his face bore a very perplexed look; but all his indignation
had vanished.</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>am</em> damned,” he muttered to himself as he
stepped into his gig. “But I’m not at all sure that I
don’t wish that they come out of it all right. I never
did like these Belgian Congo brutes.”</p>

<p>For the rest of the day the <em>Esmeralda</em> cruised about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
the entrance of the river but no other ship appeared
until the following morning when a Woermann liner
steamed from the north; she was treated in a similar
way to the <em>Leopoldville</em> greatly to the indignation of
her German captain, who came on board the cruiser
and threatened them with the vengeance of the “mailed
fist.”</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong was enjoying himself thoroughly,
and each passing day claimed one or more victims, until
the mouth of the Congo was dotted with helpless
steamers.</p>

<p>It was on the third day that a steam launch came down
the river and approached the cruiser.</p>

<p>“A visit from his Excellency, the Governor-General,”
Gaunt announced, and they gathered round the companionway
to receive the ruler of the Congo.</p>

<p>“Who is in command of this war-ship?” he demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I am responsible for its presence here,” Gaunt intervened.</p>

<p>The Count de Chambord gave him a keen look.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is as I thought. You are John Gaunt. I
should like to speak with you,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“If your Excellency will come to my cabin,” Gaunt
said politely.</p>

<p>“I received a cable from Brussels in answer to my
report upon the attack upon the <em>Leopoldville</em> in which
they suggested that you might be responsible for this
outrage. Mr. Gaunt, may I ask what you hope to gain?
Is it money?”</p>

<p>“No, Count. I stand to lose money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“And perhaps your life, for Europe will intervene,”
the Count said significantly.</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope so,” Gaunt answered cheerfully. “I
don’t think we shall do any good by this talk, for it can
lead to nothing. We have come here with a deliberate
purpose which we shall carry out to the best of our
ability. Hello! The turbines have started. Don’t
you think that we had better go on deck and see what is
happening?”</p>

<p>And the governor-general was compelled to witness
the welcome which the incoming liner, the <em>Albertville</em>,
received, for she was treated in a similar way to her sister
ship.</p>

<p>“It is a pity, for we are running rather short of
provisions at Boma,” the governor-general remarked
ruefully.</p>

<p>In his way the Count was something of a philosopher.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to put our stores at your service,”
Gaunt said politely; but the offer was as politely refused,
and the governor-general departed in his launch.</p>

<p>At dinner that night they were all very serious, for they
realized that in a very few hours the crisis would come.</p>

<p>“I think that we have been too successful; nothing has
gone wrong. No lives lost, and the Congo is at our
mercy,” Gaunt remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, until a cruiser turns up,” Captain Armstrong
answered drily.</p>

<p>Edward Drake left the mess-room and went on deck.
It was insufferably hot, and he wished to be alone. As
he strolled slowly along the deck, his lips moved in
prayer, for he understood only too well that the issue lay
in the balance. At times he had been afraid of what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
had done, for the responsibility was so great; but when
he remembered what was at stake, his courage returned.</p>

<p>“We shall win,” he told himself confidently.</p>

<p>Their cause was just, for they were fighting for freedom
and justice. Every peaceable method had been
tried, and only force had remained. The smell of the
land reached his nostrils, and in his imagination he pictured
the scenes that were taking place in the hinterland—the
maimings, the torturings, and the doing to death
of thousands of helpless fellow creatures. Yes, this land
which stretched from the mouth of the Congo for miles
was laid desolate; what had been once a densely populated
country was deserted—the work of the white
men.</p>

<p>And when he thought of Gaunt, a glad light came to
his eyes, for he had grown to love the millionaire as a
brother. And then like a fair picture Lady Ethel came
to his mind, and he wondered if she ever thought of
him.</p>

<p>“It is stifling,” Gaunt called from behind. “Dreaming,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of England.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, my friend. We have enough here to occupy
our minds. I thought that I had passed the days of tense
excitement; but now I am like a mad boy enjoying his
first gamble. Drake, I am glad I came here. And I
will tell you something—I will confess that now I have
an honest desire to help the natives,” Gaunt said quietly.</p>

<p>The next morning they steamed up the river, further
than they had hitherto been. Gaunt and Captain Drake
were on the deck, while Armstrong was standing on the
bridge with glasses in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp report—a puff of smoke
could be seen on the shore—and a shell whistled over
their heads. Another report—and—crash—the shell
pitched on the quarter-deck and a violent explosion followed.</p>

<p>Edward Drake came rushing from below, and there
was horror in his eyes when he saw two figures lying on
the deck. They were John Gaunt and his brother
Lindsay.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong gave sharp orders, and the bell of
the indicator clanged. The cruiser turned round and
raced at full speed towards the mouth of the river.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> news came to the Baron de Croiseuil when
he was lying in bed at his hotel. A long cable
in cipher from Brussels told him what had happened,
and wound up with instructions as to how he
should act. By ten o’clock he was at the foreign office,
but it was fully an hour before Sir Keith Hamilton arrived.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Baron,” the latter remarked, when
the Belgian came in; but his greeting was not returned.</p>

<p>“I have just heard from Brussels that a war-ship is
holding up all ships that enter or endeavor to leave the
Congo,” he announced dramatically.</p>

<p>It needed a long life training in diplomacy to give Sir
Keith the strength to receive the news calmly. For a
few moments he did not speak, but his mind was working
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Give me all particulars,” he at last said curtly.</p>

<p>In answer, the Baron placed before him a copy of the
cable, with his instructions omitted.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what it means?” Sir Keith asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes—Gaunt.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why you think that he is responsible?”</p>

<p>“It is evident. His disappearance, his well-known
animus against us, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think you are right,” Sir Keith interrupted
him quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do? It is rank piracy, and
the pirate is a British subject.”</p>

<p>The foreign secretary glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>“I will see you at four o’clock. In the meantime, I
must make inquiries. Au revoir.”</p>

<p>“We shall hold you responsible.”</p>

<p>“Au revoir, Baron.”</p>

<p>And Sir Keith turned deliberately away, and when he
was alone, a smile twitched at his mouth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I am altogether sorry,” he muttered,
as he rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Find out if I can see the German ambassador at once.
Then communicate with the French and American embassies,
and make appointments with the ambassadors
for two o’clock. You had better go to them yourself
and make my excuses for bringing them here. But the
matter is of vital importance,” he said to his private secretary.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Sir Keith entered Prince Von Lichtenstein’s
library.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, your Excellency. This is a copy of
a cable which the Baron de Croiseuil has received from
Brussels. It concerns the Congo.”</p>

<p>The Prince read the document, and nodded his head
once or twice.</p>

<p>“The situation has its danger,” Sir Keith continued,
“yet on the other hand, it may be a blessing in disguise.
Now we have an opportunity of settling a matter, once
for all, that might cause trouble when we are not so prepared
to meet it.”</p>

<p>“I see that a German ship has been detained and damaged,”
the Prince remarked reflectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“This is so. Also English ships. Also Belgian ones.
This pirate has made no distinction as to nationality.
Now, Prince, I am going to drop the diplomat in favor of
the philanthropist.”</p>

<p>Whereat the Prince smiled.</p>

<p>“I think the Congo question has troubled your conscience
as much as it has mine and that you would have
been prepared to intervene, had it not been for considerations
to which I will not more particularly refer.”</p>

<p>Again the Prince smiled.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that intervention has been forced
upon us. You are as little desirous of international complications
as I am. And—don’t you think that this is
a question that we might settle without the usual delays
of diplomacy? I have drawn up a scheme for the administration
of the Congo, and here is a copy, from
which you will see that I propose to govern the Free
State by a council of four. Germany, England, and
France will each appoint a member, for we are the most
concerned in the Congo, having neighboring colonies.”</p>

<p>“May I ask who is to be the fourth member?” the
Prince asked suavely.</p>

<p>“He will be the chairman, and will be appointed by
the President of the United States. I would suggest
that the chairman has a casting vote.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would solve many difficulties.”</p>

<p>“Prince, I have been as anxious as any living man to
put an end to the present iniquitous rule, but our stupid
suspicions of one another have allowed the Belgians to
work their will. I appeal to you to help me solve the
question, once and for all. I believe that the Emperor——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>“His Majesty has always been anxious to remedy the
present deplorable state of affairs. He has taken a personal
interest in the question and I may say that I have
certain powers. In fact, I think that I can accept your
proposals, subject to the consent of the other Powers.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith held out his hand which the Prince grasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we feel alike. Sometimes we may
permit ourselves to be human,” the latter remarked.</p>

<p>And it was a busy time for Sir Keith until four o’clock
came, then he was quietly smoking a cigarette in his office.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will see the Baron at once,” he said to his
secretary.</p>

<p>De Croiseuil came forward eagerly, for he had passed
a few hours of terrible suspense.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien!</i>” he remarked with well-simulated calmness.</p>

<p>Sir Keith placed a paper before him.</p>

<p>“This is a copy of a provisional agreement for the future
government of the Congo Free State, which has
been signed by the Powers interested.”</p>

<p>The Baron took the paper and his breath came in
quick gasps.</p>

<p>“You can take the copy to peruse at your leisure.
And—Baron—I am aware of the part you played in
the prosecution of John Gaunt. I may say that you are
no longer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">persona grata</i> to His Britannic Majesty’s government,
and I shall suggest that your king shall send
some other special representative.”</p>

<p>Sir Keith smiled pleasantly until the Baron had left
and then his face grew hard.</p>

<p>Then with great deliberation he lighted a cigarette and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
suddenly his face relaxed; his mouth twitched and he
burst into a laugh. Now that the tension was over he
was amazed at the precipitate way in which he had
acted; and yet it was all very simple.</p>

<p>“And the insane jealousy of England and Germany
has given the Belgians a free hand for so long, while it
appears that both the countries were anxious to put an
end to the rule of tyranny.”</p>

<p>Yes. He had done a capital day’s work, and after
all it was John Gaunt who had given him his opportunity.</p>

<p>“And now to save the fool from the consequences of
his folly,” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>A long consultation took place with the officials at the
Admiralty, and when they had arrived at a decision, the
operator above them sent forth wireless messages that
were to affect the future of John Gaunt.</p>

<p>The evening papers had already received news of the
hold-up of the Congo; the facts were related with a fair
degree of accuracy and Sir Keith read the comments
with quiet amusement.</p>

<p>“It is plain what will happen. The great British public
will make a hero of John Gaunt.”</p>

<p>In fact, the more serious of the papers were already
demanding the intervention of the government.</p>

<p>“<em>One man has shown England its duty. With fearless
courage John Gaunt has tackled the problem, and at great
risk to himself</em>,” said the <cite>Evening Herald</cite>, and went on
to demand protection for Gaunt.</p>

<p>The next day it was plain that the English people
were thoroughly roused and were determined that the
Belgian rule of the Congo must come to an end. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
parties for once were united, and a mass meeting was announced
to take place at the Royal Albert Hall.</p>

<p>Sir Keith Hamilton invited the German ambassador
to lunch.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be as well to put an end to
this clamor as soon as possible?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I have just received the Emperor’s intimation that
the agreement will be ratified. I have no objection to
its being made public at once, in spite of the vehement
protests from Belgium,” the Prince replied.</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure that the better class of Belgians
won’t be glad to hear the news. I will communicate
with the French and American ambassadors, and I hope
that we can make the news public in the morning,” said
Sir Keith.</p>

<p>And then he returned to the foreign office to receive
the Belgian ambassador, to whom he listened very
patiently.</p>

<p>“I understand from the Baron de Croiseuil that you
have taken the government of the Congo Free State
from our hands.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un fait accompli</i>, your Excellency, and won’t
permit of discussion,” Sir Keith answered with an air of
finality.</p>

<p>“This man Gaunt. Is he to be allowed to escape
without punishment? He has been guilty of an act of
rank piracy,” the ambassador cried hotly.</p>

<p>“Gaunt will be dealt with; but I cannot tell you what
punishment he will receive.”</p>

<p>At last the Belgian departed, and before Sir Keith left
his office he knew that the provisional agreement had
been ratified by the other Powers concerned. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
night a statement was sent to the press announcing the
terms of the arrangement, and in the morning enthusiastic
“leaders” appeared welcoming this solution of
the Congo problem.</p>

<p>But there was one question that troubled every one—what
was to happen to John Gaunt? And no one could
give the answer. Sir Keith Hamilton smiled to himself
as he perused a wireless message that had been sent to
him from the Admiralty.</p>

<p>“I think Stretton is the man for the job,” he muttered
reflectively.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Edward Drake</span> knelt down beside his
brother, and to his dismay saw that Lindsay was
seriously wounded. The doctor came and the
two injured men were carefully carried to the sick bay.</p>

<p>The <em>Esmeralda</em> was completely fitted up, and even
contained a small operating theatre to which Lindsay
Drake was taken—unconscious and groaning.</p>

<p>The doctor made a summary examination of both the
patients and his face was very grave when he came out.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt is not badly injured; a splinter struck
him on the head, and perhaps there is some concussion
of the brain, but there is no danger,” he announced.</p>

<p>“But my brother?” Edward Drake asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing, except to ease the pain,” was the
reluctant answer.</p>

<p>“He will die?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Vital organs are injured, and it will be useless
to operate.”</p>

<p>“I must go to him,” Drake said very quietly, but his
face was white and drawn. The doctor led the way, and
then left the brothers alone. Lindsay Drake opened his
eyes and looked listlessly at his brother.</p>

<p>“I am done for, Edward,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“It is my fault. But for me you would never have
come here.”</p>

<p>“The fortune of war, and I’m not sure that I am
altogether sorry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>Edward Drake had sunk on his knees and he spoke a
simple prayer that was eloquent of great sorrow.</p>

<p>“Doctor, shall I last long?” Lindsay asked faintly.
“This pain is more than I can bear.”</p>

<p>The doctor drew near and skillfully injected morphia.</p>

<p>“Ah! That is better,” the dying man said with a
sigh. “How long have I to live?”</p>

<p>“Captain, you are dying,” the doctor answered, and
his voice shook.</p>

<p>“Please leave us. Thank you for your kindness.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, captain.”</p>

<p>Alone, the brothers looked at one another, overwhelming
sorrow in their eyes.</p>

<p>“You know my secret, Edward. Sometimes I
thought that she cared for me, but at others I was
despondent, for what had I to offer to such a woman?”</p>

<p>“Your love, Lindsay, and I believe that that would
have meant everything to Lady Ethel.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” he said, and his eyes brightened.
“Wish her good-bye, and ask her sometimes to think of
me. Ah! Edward, I am very sentimental—I suppose
it’s the dying. It hasn’t been a bad life. I don’t believe
I’ve done many dirty actions. I’ve tried my best. But
it’s hard to think that I shall never hear her say that she
loves me.”</p>

<p>There were tears in Edward Drake’s eyes as he bent
his head and touched his brother’s forehead with his
lips.</p>

<p>“I know you’ll miss me, old chap. But perhaps my
death won’t be useless. Something tells me that you
will win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>And the eyes closed wearily, and his brow was
puckered by a frown of pain.</p>

<p>“Don’t let Ethel grieve. But perhaps she doesn’t
care. If only I knew,” he said wistfully.</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken only by his labored
breathing, and Edward knew not what to say to soothe
his brother’s dying moments. But quickly he bent his
head to listen.</p>

<p>“Mother.”</p>

<p>And it was with the name of his parent on his lips and
not that of the woman he loved, that Lindsay died.
For a long time Edward knelt there, with a great sorrow
in his heart. Gladly would he have given his own life
for his brother, but, alas, he had been able to do nothing.</p>

<p>At last he rose and gazed steadily at his brother’s face,
and there was something of awe in his eyes. Outside
the doctor was waiting and murmured a few words of
sympathy.</p>

<p>“How is Mr. Gaunt?” Edward asked quietly, and his
voice sounded strange in his ears.</p>

<p>“Still unconscious. But there is no danger, so long
as he is kept quiet.”</p>

<p>Drake went on deck where he was immediately joined
by Captain Armstrong, who gripped his hand in silent
sympathy.</p>

<p>“I have just pulled up another steamer,” the captain
remarked cheerfully; and that was his way of concealing
his sorrow.</p>

<p>Life on board continued as though nothing had
happened, but when the sun rose in the morning, every
man on the ship stood bareheaded on deck. Wearing
his robes of office, Edward Drake stood prayer-book in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
hand, and in a steady voice read the words of the burial
service over his brother’s body, which rested before him,
swathed in the flags of his country.</p>

<p>His voice died away, and he turned, and the sound of
the cleaving of water struck his ears. His face was set
and he gave a little cry when he saw that John Gaunt
was behind him.</p>

<p>“I told Mr. Gaunt that he must not come,” the doctor
cried in great distress.</p>

<p>But the millionaire smiled and held out his hand to
Drake.</p>

<p>“I wish it had been I,” he said simply, and then fell
back into the doctor’s arms unconscious.</p>

<p>“This will probably delay the recovery for weeks,” the
latter cried angrily, as he helped to carry his patient
back to his bunk.</p>

<p>When Drake looked round, he noticed that the flag
was once more flying from the top of the mast and he
sighed wearily. He blamed himself for his brother’s
death, and a feeling of great despondency held him in
its clutches. All the sweetness seemed to have vanished
from life, and yet he could not have acted differently.
Had God decreed his brother’s death as a judgment
upon him for attempting to right the wrong-doing by
force? And he sought the solitude of his cabin to
wrestle with his grief. It was not till the afternoon that he
again appeared and then his face was calm and resigned.</p>

<p>The Count de Chambord paid them another visit
and was received by Captain Armstrong, but asked to
see Gaunt.</p>

<p>“He is injured and must not be disturbed,” the captain
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>“It was reported to me that a shell had struck your
ship. I presume that you will now go about your business?”</p>

<p>“Not until we are compelled to,” was the brusque
reply.</p>

<p>“It was also reported to me that a burial took place
this morning from the ship. From the ceremony which
was observed, I wondered if it were Gaunt himself who
had been killed.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt is below and in no danger. Can I do
anything for you? If not——”</p>

<p>The captain paused significantly and the Count took
his departure without asking any more questions. During
the rest of the day they cruised around the mouth of
the river, but nothing occurred to break the monotony.
The death of Captain Drake seemed to have subdued
the spirits of all on board, for he had made himself very
popular among the men.</p>

<p>After dinner Gaunt insisted on holding a conference
with Captain Armstrong and Drake, in spite of the protests
of the doctor; and their future policy was discussed
at great length. They were in utter ignorance of what
was happening in Europe, so that they could do nothing
but wait events.</p>

<p>To the doctor’s consternation, Gaunt became feverish,
and the fever was diagnosed to be malaria. In fact,
many of the men had begun to suffer from the same
disease, in spite of the quantities of quinine that had
been served out. Edward Drake was glad of the opportunity
for action, and busied himself in nursing the sick.</p>

<p>The following day the doctor announced that Gaunt’s
temperature was dangerously high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>“He has a strong constitution, but it’s the two things
coming together,” he said, and Drake could see that he
was very anxious.</p>

<p>The heat was terrible although the ship was fitted with
electric fans, and as he sat in the sick bay, Edward Drake
felt that he too was reaching the end of his strength.
But Gaunt’s voice sounded in his ears, and he was compelled
to listen to his delirious ravings.</p>

<p>It was of the vow that he spoke and of his love for his
wife. He seemed to be living again the last few weeks
and for the first time Drake really understood how great
was his love for Lady Mildred, and what tremendous
strength of character he must possess to have been able
to keep the promise that he had made.</p>

<p>And Gaunt must die, ignorant of whether his sacrifice
of self had gained success or failure. At last the fever
broke and the delirium ceased, but the millionaire was
very weak and would require careful nursing.</p>

<p>Drake went to his cabin, but sleep was far away, for
he was thinking of his brother, and of Lady Ethel.
How should he face her and tell of Lindsay’s death?
Now he believed that she loved his brother, and in
his imagination he could see the stricken look come
into her eyes.</p>

<p>What were they doing? Lady Mildred must have
known that they were sailing on the <em>Saxon</em> or she would
not have gone to the wharf, and it was natural to think
that she would remember their talk of the Congo. They
had discussed the whole scheme in her presence. Surely
she would not remain inactive?</p>

<p>In the morning he was awakened by a summons from
Gaunt and he went to him immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“I am much better this morning. I was wondering if
we had done enough for our purpose. They tell me
that more of the men are sick. Wouldn’t it be as well
to steam away from this pestilential coast?” Gaunt
asked wearily.</p>

<p>“Are you going to weaken—now?” Drake asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of myself but of the men. If
Europe is going to intervene, she will already have done
so. I don’t see what good we shall do by remaining.”</p>

<p>“We must see it through. You are ill or I don’t
think that you would suggest that we should play the
coward.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” Gaunt answered with a sigh.</p>

<p>There is nothing more demoralizing than convalescence
after malaria, and at such moments a man is not
really responsible for himself.</p>

<p>The next day Gaunt was much better and there was a
look of shame on his face when Drake entered.</p>

<p>“I must have been mad,” he said apologetically.</p>

<p>“Not mad—only ill,” Drake answered gently.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong’s head appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“There’s a large yacht about five miles off. She’s
evidently coming to pay us a visit,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Describe her to me,” Gaunt cried quickly, and the
captain obeyed.</p>

<p>“She’s mine. It’s evidently the <em>Heron</em>,” the millionaire
cried and he looked at Drake, but neither of them spoke.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> <em>Heron</em> steamed at full speed from Southampton
to Las Palmas, but she did not travel
fast enough for Lady Mildred, who made Captain
Samson’s life miserable by the way she worried him.</p>

<p>“Won’t she go any faster, captain?”</p>

<p>“No, my lady. She is doing over twenty-four knots,”
he answered reproachfully.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at Las Palmas, Lord Lynton
hastened ashore and it was not very long before he ascertained
that a number of men had left the island to
join a cruiser. He returned with this information and
there could be no doubt that Gaunt had gone to the
Congo.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred sent for the captain and announced
their destination.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a fit place for your ladyship to visit. You
will be sure to get fever,” he protested nervously.</p>

<p>“We start at once, captain. Mr. Gaunt is there, and
it is important that we arrive at the earliest possible moment,”
Lady Mildred answered, and then proceeded to
tell the story of Gaunt’s expedition.</p>

<p>The captain listened in open-eyed amazement, but he
no longer hesitated, and orders were given that the yacht
should sail at once. To Lady Mildred these few days
seemed interminable, and as they drew near her suspense
increased. At last the mouth of the Congo came in
sight and with the aid of glasses they could see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
many disabled steamers. It was Captain Samson who
first made out the <em>Esmeralda</em> and he came from the
bridge to tell them.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred was putting on a pith helmet and her
face had grown very pale.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has happened?” she muttered to herself.
“Captain, will you get a launch ready? I want to
go on board at once,” she said aloud.</p>

<p>“There is a pinnace putting off from the cruiser, my
lady, and she is traveling towards us at a good speed,”
the captain answered.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred put the glasses to her eyes and gave a
cry at what she saw.</p>

<p>“There is only one man astern. It is not John. I
think it is Mr. Drake.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” Lady Ethel cried eagerly, and she almost
snatched the glasses from her sister.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred turned away for she wished to hide her
distress. It was evident that they had recognized the
<em>Heron</em>, and why had not her husband come to meet her?
Was it that he could not forgive her?</p>

<p>Sailors were busy lowering the companion way, and
the launch drew alongside. Edward Drake jumped lightly
onto the platform and hastened up to greet them.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Gaunt?” Lady Mildred cried, before
he could utter a word.</p>

<p>“He is ill, and the doctor says that he is not fit to stand
any excitement. That is why I have hastened to meet
you,” he answered quickly.</p>

<p>“What has happened? Is he dangerously ill?” she
asked, and her voice shook with fear.</p>

<p>“No. He is out of danger. Shall we go to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
cabin? I have a lot to tell you,” he asked; and Lady
Mildred led the way.</p>

<p>Edward Drake stood and faced them, and they could
see the deep lines brought to his face by grief and pain.
But his voice was steady when he began to tell them all
that had happened. It was only when he spoke of his
brother’s death that he faltered, and dared not look at
Lady Ethel.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt is in no danger, but you must be very
careful. Before you go to the <em>Heron</em> I should like to
speak to you alone, Lady Mildred.”</p>

<p>Lord Lynton and Lady Ethel moved away, and for
the first time Drake glanced at the woman he loved.
She was crying quietly, and tears were streaming down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>When they had gone, he turned to Lady Mildred, and
his face was very grave.</p>

<p>“I think I am justified in breaking a confidence. I
have thought deeply, and am sure it is my duty to tell
you the reason why your husband has acted as he has
done. I am aware that you have felt bitter towards him,
but it was because you did not know.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Drake, you need not tell me. I am ashamed of
my conduct, and I have come to my husband to ask his
forgiveness,” she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Still, I think you should know. Gaunt is a man in a
thousand, and I want you to understand his character.
He has always loved you passionately from the first time
you met, but he was determined to conceal his love until
he had won you. He thought he was succeeding until
that terrible day when it seemed that in all human probability
you would die. Gaunt was in utter despair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
in his agony he turned to God. You must remember
that the specialist had told him that there was no hope
of your living. He prayed to God, and made a bargain
with Him. Gaunt told me the very words he used, and
they are imprinted on my memory. ‘Give me the life
of my wife, and I swear that every action of my life shall
be deliberately thought out, and shall be in accordance
with the teaching of Christ.’”</p>

<p>Drake paused, and he could see that Lady Mildred
was listening with breathless attention.</p>

<p>“And since that night, when God gave him your life,
he has struggled nobly to keep that vow. That is the
reason why——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” she cried harshly.</p>

<p>Her face worked painfully as everything became clear
to her mind. She knew her husband’s pride that he always
kept his word, and she could understand how
fiercely he must have been tempted to abandon the fulfilment
of his vow, and it was she herself who had made
his task a thousand times more difficult.</p>

<p>“What a man!” she muttered feverishly.</p>

<p>And pride and love overwhelmed her so that she grew
afraid.</p>

<p>“You are sure that his life is not in danger?” she said
tremulously.</p>

<p>“Quite. So long as you do not excite him.”</p>

<p>“You may trust me, Mr. Drake. His life is too precious
to me.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips.</p>

<p>“And I am proud of your friendship for my husband.
But I have been selfish. I have forgotten your terrible
loss. What can I say to comfort you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>“And your sister, for I believe she loved Lindsay.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick look, but remained silent.</p>

<p>“May I go to John at once? I promise that I will be
quite calm,” she said at last.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the launch was rapidly taking them
to the cruiser. Drake refused to allow either Lord
Lynton or Lady Ethel to accompany them, and he
would give no reason for his refusal.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the deck of the cruiser,
Drake hastened to the sick bay.</p>

<p>“Gaunt, your wife is here,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Bring her to me, and you will leave us alone.”</p>

<p>And Lady Mildred stood in the doorway, hesitated for
a moment, then ran to the bunk where her husband lay.</p>

<p>“John.”</p>

<p>She knelt by his side and pressed her lips to his.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, dear. I was cruel, but I did not understand,”
she whispered.</p>

<p>Their eyes met and there was no need for words.
Understanding came to them and the past seemed as
though it had not been. And she sat by his side, her
hand resting on his, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>“You should not have come,” he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>But she leant over and kissed him on the lips.</p>

<p>“I care for nothing so long as I am with you,” she
whispered tenderly.</p>

<p>The doctor came in, glanced keenly at his patient, and
relief came to his face when he had felt Gaunt’s pulse.</p>

<p>“May I stay? I will be very quiet,” Lady Mildred
said appealingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that he is already better, but don’t talk
too much,” the doctor said warningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>Soon Lady Mildred began to think of the future. In
her anxiety for her husband’s health, she had forgotten
that they were in a war-ship, that had been guilty of acts
that might be regarded as piratical.</p>

<p>What would happen? Would John be punished for
what he had done? She dared not question him, but she
felt that she must know. His eyes were closed and she
tried to remove her hand from his, but he stirred
restlessly. At last his grip relaxed, and she went on
deck where she found Edward Drake who was talking to
Captain Armstrong.</p>

<p>“What is going to be the end of this?” she asked,
and waved her hands towards the disabled steamers.</p>

<p>“We shall know in an hour’s time,” the captain answered.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There are war-ships on the horizon and they are
coming here.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you escape while there is time?”
she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ask Mr. Drake,” the captain said drily.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>“We have acted as our consciences directed, and we
are prepared to face the responsibility for what we have
done,” Drake said quietly.</p>

<p>“But you may be severely punished. You, and my
husband. Mr. Gaunt is ill. Escape while there is
time,” she cried excitedly.</p>

<p>Drake shook his head decidedly, and she appealed to
Captain Armstrong.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be better to go?”</p>

<p>“It is not a matter of opinion. Before we came here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
we laid down a line of action which we shall faithfully
carry out. It might be worse, for we are not responsible
for any loss of life, save on our own side.”</p>

<p>“Poor Captain Drake,” she said sadly, and tears came
to her eyes.</p>

<p>There was a cry from the bridge.</p>

<p>“The first flies the White Ensign.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it is our own people, and no beastly
foreigners,” the captain said grimly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> flag-ship of the admiral of the Atlantic
cruiser squadron was the <em>Invincible</em> and she
led as the fleet swept towards the mouth of the
river.</p>

<p>Admiral Stretton was on the quarter-deck, and there
was a grim smile on his face as he looked at the disabled
steamers.</p>

<p>“They certainly haven’t been idle,” he muttered to
himself.</p>

<p>His flag-lieutenant approached and saluted.</p>

<p>“The barge is ready, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>The cruiser’s twelve inch guns were pointed full on
the <em>Esmeralda</em> and the crew stood at their quarters.
The fleet had ceased moving and the semaphore on the
flag-ship was busily signaling orders.</p>

<p>The admiral entered the barge, accompanied by his
flag-lieutenant, and they started off at once. Captain
Armstrong stood at the gangway of the cruiser. He
was dressed in a suit of drill and wore the white pith
helmet of the civilian, but his hand was brought sharply
to the salute.</p>

<p>“I have seen you before, sir,” the admiral said grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You were in the service?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be as well if I do not ask you your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
name. Who is the lady?” the admiral demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p>“I am Lady Mildred Gaunt,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p>“Take me to your cabin,” the admiral said gruffly to
the captain, and did not speak again till they were alone.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty business, sir. Do you realize that
you have forced my squadron to come to this diabolical
spot? You deserve hanging,” the admiral said angrily.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong did not answer, but there was a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“You can tell me your story. You may as well start
at the beginning.”</p>

<p>Now and then Armstrong was stopped to answer a
question, but very quickly the admiral knew everything
there was to be known.</p>

<p>“A mad adventure from the start, sir.”</p>

<p>“Has it succeeded, sir? We have had no news at all,”
Armstrong asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“The Powers have taken over the Congo, if that’s
what you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Pardon me, sir. I will be back in a
minute,” Armstrong cried and hastened to Drake with
the news.</p>

<p>“We’ve beaten the beggars,” he cried triumphantly.</p>

<p>Drake’s face flushed, and then became ashen.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he whispered hoarsely, and Armstrong repeated
the admiral’s words.</p>

<p>“I must go and let Gaunt know,” Drake said excitedly,
and Armstrong returned to his cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what punishment do you think you and
that man Gaunt deserve? What am I to do with you?”
the admiral asked grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>“That depends upon your instructions, sir,” Armstrong
answered with a smile.</p>

<p>The admiral smiled, and took a cigarette from a silver
box on the table.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have received my instructions, as you suggest.
Armstrong, I will drop the official, and will speak
to you as man to man.”</p>

<p>“You know my name.”</p>

<p>“Yes—unofficially. Now I am going to give you a
hint. The fleet will be off the mouth of the river to-night,
but I cannot guarantee that a careful watch will be
kept. In fact, I think that a man who has had experience
in handling a destroyer might creep out without
being seen,” the admiral remarked slowly and significantly.</p>

<p>“I understand, sir.”</p>

<p>“I must see Gaunt. I have a message for him.”</p>

<p>“He is very ill.”</p>

<p>“Still, I must see him,” the admiral said, and the
words amounted to an order.</p>

<p>Lady Mildred, who had been seated by her husband,
rose when they entered and looked questioningly at the
admiral.</p>

<p>“My husband must not be disturbed,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I must deliver a message to him, my
lady. Armstrong, you can go.”</p>

<p>The captain saluted and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaunt, I won’t trouble you with a long discourse.
To-night Captain Armstrong will sail this cruiser for San
Salvador. Sir Keith Hamilton thinks that that will be
the best solution, for it would be impossible to procure a
conviction should you be tried in England. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
suggest that, when it is dark, you, your wife and the
parson, go to the yacht. It would be as well if you also
have disappeared by daybreak. I myself shall have to
stay here while my engineers make good some of the
damage you have done.”</p>

<p>“Am I to understand that I am to be allowed to go
free?” Gaunt asked quietly.</p>

<p>“It amounts to that,” the admiral answered.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” Lady Mildred cried fervently, and
her face was aglow with joy.</p>

<p>“In my last wireless from the Admiralty, there was a
message for you from Sir Keith Hamilton. ‘Tell Gaunt
that he may consider himself a lucky man, and suggest
that he take a twelvemonth voyage round the world,
for the benefit of his health.’ In my opinion the advice
is good.”</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and Captain Armstrong
entered.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General’s launch is making for the
flag-ship, sir, and I think his Excellency is on board.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid he will have to wait a while. I
don’t know that I am particularly anxious to see him
till you are safely out of the way. Perhaps Lady Mildred
would give me some tea?” the admiral said with a
deferential bow.</p>

<p>Like the majority of sailors, the admiral had an eye for
a pretty woman, and Lady Mildred smiled graciously, for
she was very grateful for the mercy that was being
shown to her husband.</p>

<p>She looked at Gaunt and read consent in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Captain Armstrong will join us,” she said
demurely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>It was dusk when the admiral left and an hour later a
launch left the <em>Esmeralda</em> for the <em>Heron</em>. Gaunt was
carefully covered with blankets, and stood the journey
well.</p>

<p>Captain Armstrong had accompanied them and shook
hands with his companions in adventure.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Gaunt. I hope that you will be quite fit
when we meet again. Good-bye, Padre,” and he gripped
their hands tightly.</p>

<p>And when morning came the <em>Esmeralda</em> and the
<em>Heron</em> had vanished from the mouth of the Congo.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the distance could be seen the Peak of Teneriffe,
gleaming white among the clouds, and the <em>Heron</em>
was steaming steadily towards the island.</p>

<p>Aft of the yacht John Gaunt lay on a deck chair with
his wife sitting close to him. Her hand rested in his,
and there was peace and contentment on her face. Already
the millionaire was better, and there was a little
color on his cheeks, but there was a moody expression
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I am very happy, dearest,” Lady Mildred whispered.</p>

<p>But he did not answer, and she looked at him in wonder.</p>

<p>“Something is troubling you—what is it?”</p>

<p>“It is only that I have decided to go back to England
when all the time I am longing to continue this voyage
forever.”</p>

<p>“Why do you wish to return to England? Remember
Sir Keith’s advice.”</p>

<p>“I must go, Mildred. There is a warrant out for my
arrest, and the more manly course is to go and face the
music.”</p>

<p>“But they may imprison you,” she cried vehemently.</p>

<p>“I must risk that, dear one. You wouldn’t have me
play the coward.”</p>

<p>“No. I can only wish you to do what you believe to
be your duty, John.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>“I thought you would say that. Call the captain to
me.”</p>

<p>Gaunt’s eyes followed his wife with simple adoration.</p>

<p>“Captain, we sail straight for Southampton at full
speed.”</p>

<p>Edward Drake had drawn near, and he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“I had been hoping that you would decide to do
that,” he said joyfully.</p>

<p>These last few days he had been struggling for the
courage to give to Lady Ethel his brother’s last message,
but he had dreaded to see her suffer. Now he could
no longer postpone the unpleasant duty, and so he went
to the saloon where he found her reading, and she looked
up with a smile when he entered.</p>

<p>“Lady Ethel, there is something that I have been trying
to tell you,” he began in a low voice.</p>

<p>The color came to her cheeks, and she could not
look at him.</p>

<p>“Lindsay sent you a message. You know that he
loved you as man rarely loves woman. He asked me
to tell you that he would have died happy if he could
only have known that you cared for him.”</p>

<p>Tears dimmed her eyes, but still she did not look at
him.</p>

<p>“He was a man worthy of any woman’s love, and I
believe that you would have been happy with him. I
often watched you together, and it seemed to me that you
did love him. It is something that we can share one
another’s grief for his loss. If his life had been spared,
we might have been brother and sister.”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes to him and he gave a cry of
amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>“Ethel,” he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Yes, I loved your brother as you love him—as a
sister would love him, and, Edward, I have sorrowed for
your sorrow. I have seen you suffering, and I could
not speak.”</p>

<p>“Ethel, is it true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered tremulously.</p>

<p>But the revulsion of feeling was too great and he
stood before her, wonder, incredulity, and love in his
eyes. In a moment his arms were around her, and
he kissed her passionately, her hair—her eyes—her
lips.</p>

<p>“My darling, do you love me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Edward, for a very long time, but I did not always
know it. I am glad you have told me, for now I can
help to comfort you. I can share in your sorrow, for we
have both lost a brother.”</p>

<p>And they told one another those things that are
music to lovers’ ears. Suddenly Drake drew himself
away.</p>

<p>“Do you realize that I am a poor man, and can offer
you nothing?”</p>

<p>“Except love—and that is everything,” she interrupted
him gently.</p>

<p>Gaunt and his wife were unfeignedly glad to hear
the news, and after dinner the two men had a long talk.</p>

<p>“Drake, I have been thinking about my future.
Whatever happens in England, I have determined upon
my course of action. I believe that the attempt to fulfil
my vow has made me a better man. I seem to see
things differently and I am going to try to live the rest
of my days—— It is difficult to explain, and I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
your help. We will use my wealth together. You
shall carry on your work in the East End of London, and
you shall have all the money you require. I intend to
make a settlement on your marriage to Ethel. No,
don’t protest. I’m not thinking of you, but there may
be others——”</p>

<p>“You are very generous,” Drake said with deep emotion.</p>

<p>He himself cared nothing for wealth, but it was
pleasant to know that his wife would not be deprived of
the luxuries to which she had been accustomed.</p>

<p>The voyage was an uneventful one and when Southampton
was reached they proceeded straight to London.</p>

<p>It was not till late the next morning that the news of
Gaunt’s arrival became known, and when he drove to
Bow Street Police Court, the streets were thronged with
an enthusiastic crowd who gave him the reception that is
generally accorded to a popular hero.</p>

<p>He surrendered himself to the police, and later in the
day was brought before the magistrate.</p>

<p>The proceedings were over in a few minutes. Mr.
Ruggles, K. C., rose and spoke a few sentences.</p>

<p>“My clients have instructed me to withdraw the case,
and I do so without comment.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard Tester then rose.</p>

<p>“I should like my client to have an opportunity of
stating on oath what really occurred, and how Marillier
was killed.”</p>

<p>The magistrate agreed, and Gaunt went into the witness
box. The story was soon told and when he was
formally discharged, a cheer was raised in the court, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
it was with the utmost difficulty that he made his way
back to the car. During the afternoon he found out
that the case brought by the Amanti Company against
Davis had collapsed from lack of evidence, and so that
worry disappeared.</p>

<p>A week later Lady Ethel was quietly married to
Edward Drake, and they started for the south of
France, where Gaunt and his wife were to meet them
in the yacht.</p>

<p>Sir Keith Hamilton was present at the wedding and
dined that night at Gaunt House.</p>

<p>“You are a lucky man, Gaunt. You bring about an
international revolution and escape without punishment.
More than that, you become the idol of the great British
public.”</p>

<p>“I owe a great deal to you, and am very grateful,”
Gaunt answered earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then tell me one thing—what was your motive in
taking up the cause of the natives of the Congo?” Sir
Keith asked slowly.</p>

<p>Gaunt did not answer, but his eyes met his wife’s
and they exchanged a look of perfect understanding.</p>

<p>And Sir Keith wondered and still wonders.</p>
